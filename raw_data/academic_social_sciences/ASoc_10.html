Intervening early to provide maltreated children with safe, nurturing care can improve outcomes. The need for prompt decisions about permanent placement (i.e., regarding adoption or return home) is internationally recognised.

This paper describes the protocol of the first exploratory randomised controlled trial of a mental health intervention aimed at improving placement permanency decisions for maltreated children. This trial compares an infant's mental health intervention with the new enhanced service as usual for maltreated children entering care in Glasgow. As both are new services, the trial is being conducted from a position of equipoise. The outcome assessment covers various fields of a child&amp;#x2019;s neurodevelopment to identify problems in any ESSENCE domain. The feasibility, reliability, and developmental appropriateness of all outcome measures are examined. Additionally, the potential for linkage with routinely collected data on health and social care and, in the future, education is explored.

 maltreatment is associated with life-long social, physical, and mental 
health problems. Intervening early to provide maltreated children with 
safe, nurturing care can improve outcomes. The need for prompt decisions
 about permanent placement (i.e., regarding adoption or return home) is 
internationally recognised. However, a recent Glasgow audit showed that 
many maltreated children “revolve” between birth families and foster 
carers. This paper describes the protocol of the first exploratory 
randomised controlled trial of a mental health intervention aimed at 
improving placement permanency decisions for maltreated children. This 
trial compares an infant's mental health intervention with the new 
enhanced service as usual for maltreated children entering care in 
Glasgow. As both are new services, the trial is being conducted from a 
position of equipoise. The outcome assessment covers various fields of a
 child’s neurodevelopment to identify problems in any ESSENCE domain. 
The feasibility, reliability, and developmental appropriateness of all 
outcome measures are examined. Additionally, the potential for linkage 
with routinely collected data on health and social care and, in the 
future, education is explored. The results will inform a definitive 
randomised controlled trial that could potentially lead to long lasting 
benefits for the Scottish population and which may be applicable to 
other areas of the world. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NC01485510).</p><span class="end-abs"></span><h4 id="sec1">1. Background</h4><p>Child maltreatment is known to be associated with significant problems in later life affecting both physical [<a href="#B1">1</a>] and mental health [<a href="#B2">2</a>–<a href="#B4">4</a>]. Intervening early can improve outcomes when children’s social and emotional development is at risk [<a href="#B5">5</a>],
 and recovery from the effects of maltreatment is possible if children 
are provided with safe and nurturing care early, ideally in the first 
year of life [<a href="#B6">6</a>–<a href="#B8">8</a>]. Failure to do so puts children at risk of disrupted attachments and poor emotional well-being [<a href="#B9">9</a>].
 There is a growing international research and policy consensus on the 
need for prompt decisions about permanent placement (i.e., regarding 
adoption or return home) so that children can experience secure care as 
early as possible [<a href="#B9">9</a>–<a href="#B14">14</a>]. However, a
 recent audit of services in Glasgow revealed that children frequently 
“revolve” between maltreating birth parents and various temporary foster
 placements [<a href="#B10">10</a>]. Moreover, there are no infant mental health services focusing on maltreated infants in Scotland.</p><p>There have been attempts to develop interventions to improve the mental health of maltreated infants [<a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B7">7</a>], but only one evaluated programme was identified, the Tulane Infant Team in New Orleans, Louisiana [<a href="#B8">8</a>].
 This is still in operation and aims to improve the permanency 
decision-making process using a comprehensive mental health 
intervention. Permanency decisions involve placing a child in the care 
of one family until the child reaches the age of independence. The 
Tulane Infant Team offers a tailored intervention to every family with a
 child coming into care. It assesses the quality of child’s 
relationships and the degree of change over the course of the 
intervention. It makes considered recommendations to inform the legal 
system about the best placement outcome for each child. The aim of the 
Tulane Infant Team is to rehabilitate children back to their birth 
parents, and when this cannot be achieved safely or quickly enough, to 
free the children for adoption. An evaluation based on analysis of 
routine data was conducted four years prior to and four years after the 
introduction of this intervention to New Orleans [<a href="#B8">8</a>]. 
This suggested that more children were adopted following its 
introduction; however, for those returned to birth families, there was a
 significant reduction in repeated maltreatment both for that child and 
subsequent siblings. The limitation of the study was a consecutive 
cohort design, and the lack of randomisation means that factors other 
than the intervention may be contributing to the positive effects. </p><p>Deciding which are the most appropriate outcome measures for this population is challenging. Gillberg [<a href="#B11">11</a>]
 described the high levels of coexistence between symptoms of different 
disorders in early childhood, which he defined as ESSENCE (Early 
Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical 
Examinations). This demonstrates the need for a diverse and thorough 
assessment across the various fields described by Gillberg [<a href="#B11">11</a>], including general development, language, social interrelatedness, mood, and behaviour. </p><p>The
 overall aim of this exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to
 evaluate the feasibility and to inform the design of a definitive RCT 
evaluating a Scottish adaptation of the New Orleans intervention for 
maltreated children. The specific research questions are as follows:<span class="list"><span class="list-item"><span class="list-label">(1)</span><span class="list-content">what

Methods/Design</h4><h5 id="sec2.1">2.1. Study Design and Setting</h5><p>This
 study is an RCT comparing two arms: GIFT (the intervention arm) and 
FACS (enhanced version of services as usual arm). Outcome measures from 
all participants are being collected one month after a child comes into 
care and then again one year later.</p><p>The study is set in the city 
of Glasgow, Scotland’s largest and most ethnically diverse city with an 
estimated population of 588,470 of which almost 6% represent an ethnic 
minority (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3969">http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3969</a>).
 Children represent 16% of the Glasgow population; over one-third live 
in areas in the most deprived decile within Scotland, whilst only 3% 
live in areas in the least deprived decile within Scotland.</p><h5 id="sec2.2">2.2. Participants</h5><p>All
 parents (or recognised parental guardians) with a child aged between 6 
and 60 months who come into a period of care due to child protection 
concerns are invited to take part in the study. Children are excluded 
from the study if<span class="list"><span class="list-item"><span class="list-label">(1)</span><span class="list-content">they have a profound learning disability (as assessment outcome measures would not be appropriate), </span></span><span class="list-item"><span class="list-label">(2)</span><span class="list-content">and/or
 their primary caregiver is unavailable to take part in the intervention
 (such as long-term imprisonment, death, or being uncontactable by 
services or research team for 3 months or more). </span></span></span></p><h5 id="sec2.3">2.3. Recruitment and Randomisation</h5><p>Recruitment
 is taking place over 17 months from December 2011 to April 2013. An 
estimated 153 eligible children are expected to enter care due to 
maltreatment during this period, that is, 9 children per month. Consent 
from parents and foster carers to be approached by the research team to 
discuss the study is obtained by the social worker who gives the 
potential participants an information leaflet and a digital video disc 
explaining the study, its intent, and what participation would entail. 
Thereafter, informed consent from those agreeing to be contacted is 
obtained by the study’s recruitment officer. </p><p>An anticipated 
consent rate of 65% will include approximately 100 families in the 
study, with 50 children in each trial arm (Figure <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/838042/fig1/">1</a>).
 The families are randomly allocated to GIFT or FACS by the Robertson 
Centre for Biostatistics. Children from the same birth family, 
regardless of placement, are assigned the same study arm to reduce 
contamination (as birth parents are the primary target of the 
intervention). Randomisation is also stratified by child’s age (&lt;2 
and ≥2 years). The trial arm allocation is concealed from the 
researchers who carry out the baseline and follow-up assessments, and 
the first research assessment is carried out prior to randomisation.</p><div class="fig"><div class="figgroupcaption"><a target="_blank" class="thumbnail" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/838042/fig1/"><img alt="838042.fig.001" src="ASSc_10_files/838042.jpg" /></a></div><div class="groupcaption"><b>Figure 1: </b>Anticipated number of eligible children recruited and randomised in the trial between December 2011 and April 2013.</div></div><h5 id="sec2.4">2.4. Care as Usual: Family Assessment and Contact Service (FACS)</h5><p>FACS
 comprises a team of social workers, which undertakes an assessment of 
the child and the family in order to make a decision about the child’s 
future care. It examines family functioning and makes recommendations 
regarding placement outcomes for children. It is able to refer family 
members onto additional services (e.g., drug rehabilitation). Although 
FACS is an established service in Glasgow, it was previously a 
specialised team assessing only small numbers of children. As the 
delivery of early assessment services in Scotland was known to be highly
 heterogeneous, FACS will offer a new level of consistency and therefore
 is considered to be “enhanced services as usual”. Any child whose 
parent or foster carer does not consent to participate in the research 
study will therefore receive the service from FACS.</p><h5 id="sec2.5">2.5. The Trial Intervention: Glasgow Infant and Family Team (GIFT)</h5><p>GIFT
 is a structured intervention with the primary goal of rehabilitating 
the child back with their primary caregiver, when it is safe to do so. 
The team is multidisciplinary incorporating social workers, 
psychologists, a psychotherapist, and a psychiatrist. Like FACS, GIFT 
makes an assessment of the children in the context of their 
relationships with their caregivers. Whilst both teams assess 
relationships with the birth parents, GIFT also always assesses the 
relationships with foster carers. GIFT arranges referrals onto other 
services as described in FACS. GIFT also offers an intensive 
relationship focussed intervention to every birth family, which is 
anticipated to take between 6 and 9 months. This intervention is aimed 
at improving the relationship between the child and his/her birth family
 and according to the outcome, GIFT recommends whether the children 
should return home or be adopted. The intention is that all foster 
carers who care for children coming to the GIFT intervention should be 
jointly registered as potential adopters so that, if rehabilitation home
 is not feasible, the child does not have to experience another change 
of placement before achieving permanency. However, it is likely that 
this will take time to achieve and that not all carers will be dually 
registered within the recruitment period.</p><h5 id="sec2.6">2.6. Outcome Measures</h5><p>Baseline
 assessment based on the outcome measures is administered at a minimum 
of one month after the child is received into care. One month is allowed
 to let the carer get to know the child as well as to allow for the 
child to settle into the carer’s home. Follow up assessment of the 
outcome measures is then repeated one year later. At baseline, the 
assessment is completed for all children with their foster carers. At 
follow up, the assessment is completed with the child’s primary 
caregiver at that time who may be the birth parent, adoptive parent, or 
the foster carer—who may be the same or different from the foster carer 
at baseline. </p><h5 id="sec2.7">2.7. Primary Outcome Measure</h5><p>Infant mental health is measured using the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) [<a href="#B12">12</a>, <a href="#B13">13</a>]. This 166-item questionnaire is well validated and is completed by the parent or carer [<a href="#B14">14</a>].
 It covers a wide range of social and emotional behaviours in infants, 
across four domains: externalising, internalising, dysregulation, and 
competence. It has been used successfully in previous interventions 
research with maltreated children showing medium to large effect sizes 
and good longitudinal stability [<a href="#B15">15</a>]. </p><h5 id="sec2.8">2.8. Secondary Outcome Measures</h5><p>A
 cognitive assessment of the child is undertaken. Children under 2.5 
years are assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development [<a href="#B16">16</a>], while children 2.5 years and over are assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI IV) [<a href="#B17">17</a>]. The parent or carer also completes the Parent Evaluation of Development Status (PEDS) [<a href="#B18">18</a>] which assesses cognitive milestones including language, the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI) [<a href="#B19">19</a>] which identifies symptoms of attachment disorders, the Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment of Functioning (PIR-GAS) [<a href="#B20">20</a>]
 which assesses global relationship functioning following observation of
 both play and meal time activities, and the Paediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PedsQL) [<a href="#B21">21</a>] which assesses health-related quality of life. The Development and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA) [<a href="#B22">22</a>]
 is completed by carers with a child aged two and above and is used to 
generate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) codes. The Waiting Room
 Observation (WRO) [<a href="#B23">23</a>], a structured observation for
 symptoms of attachment disorders, is also completed by the researcher 
when the child and carer first arrive at the clinic. In addition, the 
Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) [<a href="#B24">24</a>], the gold standard measure of infant/toddler attachment patterns, is completed at the follow-up time only. </p><p>In addition, the “This Is My Baby” (TIMB) [<a href="#B25">25</a>]
 interview, which assesses the degree of commitment to the child by the 
foster carer is included as it may be investigated as a potential 
moderator between maltreatment and outcome.</p><p>In this exploratory 
trial, the feasibility, reliability, and developmental appropriateness 
of each measure will be examined in order to select the best measures 
for a definitive trial. In addition, the potential for linkage of data 
with routinely collected data on health and social care and, in the 
future, education and legal services will be explored. </p><h5 id="sec2.9">2.9. Data and Statistical Analysis</h5><p>The
 study will be analysed using the intention-to-treat analysis. To make 
preliminary assessment of the efficacy of GIFT, changes in scores on the
 ITSEA competence scale will be compared between the GIFT and FACS 
groups, adjusting for important baseline variables. To assess 
feasibility, the percentage consenting and the retention rate will be 
estimated: whether these are related to social circumstances or the type
 of intervention will be investigated using routine data where possible.
 </p><h5 id="sec2.10">2.10. Treatment Fidelity</h5><p>A fidelity 
monitoring model will be tailored to the specific needs of this complex 
intervention. This aims to capture five key components of fidelity [<a href="#B26">26</a>]
 encompassing adherence to the prescribed intervention (staff 
supervision, training, and participant attendance), exposure (volume of 
trial intervention received per family), quality of delivery (monitoring
 assessment and treatment reports, focus group data), responsiveness of 
families (attendance and case studies), and program differentiation 
(identifying distinctive features and challenges). The purpose of the 
model is to ensure that the key components of the intervention are 
maintained throughout the study, to identify challenges and areas of 
improvement, and to generate data with which to compare evaluation 
results with the performance of the intervention.</p><h5 id="sec2.11">2.11. Health Economics</h5><p>An
 economic model will be built and populated with data from the trial to 
explore the potential cost-effectiveness of GIFT in comparison to FACS, 
using the ITSEA measure of child’s mental health. Child’s quality of 
life will also be measured within trial using the PedsQL for infants and
 toddlers. Measurement of quality of life is an important input for the 
economic component of this study and will enable assessment of any 
short-term change in quality of life for children between baseline and 1
 year, and also between the trial arms. The model will be analysed 
probabilistically in order to characterize uncertainty in the model 
parameters and estimate confidence limits around the cost and 
effectiveness outcomes. The economic model will be used to help design 
the definitive trial proposal.</p><h5 id="sec2.12">2.12. Qualitative Process Evaluation</h5><p>Qualitative
 mapping and modelling work will accompany the exploratory trial in 
order to track the ways in which FACS and GIFT evolve and impact as 
services, capturing and exploring issues as they arise throughout the 
trial and feeding into service development. Qualitative work in the 
first part of the trial focuses on the implementation and delivery of 
services from the perspectives of social workers, foster carers, and the
 GIFT and FACS teams. The main data collection method for this purpose 
is focus group discussions, which will be repeated throughout the trial 
in order to track changes and developments over time. The trial consent 
process is also a focus in this first phase with data being collected 
from birth parents and foster carers who consent to the study, as well 
as the professionals responsible for the consent procedure. The second 
phase of the study, although still tracking the development of issues 
already gleaned in the first phase, will adopt case study methodology to
 focus more specifically on the impact of GIFT and FACS on a selection 
of children and families involved in the trial. This narrower focus will
 allow an in-depth investigation into the process of experience from the
 perspectives of the birth family, foster carers, social workers, and 
health professionals surrounding specific children enrolled in the 
trial. Case studies will be selected on the basis of a criterion matrix 
to allow exploration of the experience of receiving both services and 
different outcomes regarding permanency decisions. Key to this stage of 
the research is also the gathering of qualitative data from the 
Children’s Hearing System (a panel of specifically trained lay people 
who, in Scotland, are involved in most child’s welfare decisions) in 
order to explore perspectives about the reports from the service and 
their impact on decision making. </p><p>The study was approved by the 
West of Scotland NHS Research Ethics Committee 5 and NHS Greater Glasgow
 and Clyde (Research and Development Committee). In addition, the 
research team attended Good Clinical Practice Training and also a 
study-specific session on obtaining informed consent from very 
vulnerable families. The protocol was registered before recruitment 
began on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/</a>.</p><h4 id="sec3">3. Discussion</h4><p>Both
 FACS and GIFT are new services and, during the mapping and modelling 
phase of this study, it was clear that opinion was divided as to which 
was likely to provide the best service for maltreated children. We are 
therefore in a position of equipoise.</p><p>The results from the study 
will provide us with the necessary findings in order to conduct a 
definitive RCT evaluating the New Orleans intervention for maltreated 
children. We aim to identify the feasibility of recruiting birth and 
foster families and the retention of these families to both the research
 and the interventions. We will assess not only the appropriateness of 
each measure but the assessments ability to capture problems in any 
ESSENCE domain. We will also explore the outcomes of the interventions. 
We will use fidelity monitoring to ascertain and optimise adherence to 
the GIFT model and to document the delivery of the control intervention.
 Health economic techniques will be used to assess the implications of 
such a model in terms of both the costs and outcomes, the results of 
which will feed into the development and design of a definitive RCT. In 
addition, we will explore qualitatively the perspectives of those 
implementing, delivering, and receiving the interventions as part of 
investigating the feasibility of implementing the model of intervention.
 In time, we will also examine the impact of the trial on the wider 
systems through routine data follow up. </p><p>Both GIFT and FACS aim to
 identify care arrangements which will ensure that the future care of 
any child who has experienced maltreatment is safe and nurturing. This 
could potentially lead to a long lasting benefit for the Scottish 
population as a whole, as well as a reduction in costs to society. 
Should the GIFT intervention be beneficial to infant’s mental health and
 cost-effective in comparison to FACS, it would be important to consider
 whether a GIFT intervention could be of benefit in other areas of the 
UK to improve the life chances of maltreated children and address key 
policy goals such as improvement of school readiness and community 
safety. </p><h5 id="sec3.1">3.1. Limitations</h5><p>The GIFT team only 
has the capacity for a caseload of 50–60 children in one year. This 
limited capacity means that children removed from parents due to 
maltreatment but then placed in kinship care, being looked after by 
family members, are not included. This accounts for a large number of 
children who are removed from birth parents due to maltreatment. 
Children in kinship care may be included in future trials.</p><p>An 
additional limitation is that some children will change placement 
between baseline and follow up, meaning that there will be different 
respondents. If one intervention proves better at achieving permanent 
placements than the other, then the number of placement moves is likely 
to vary between the arms of the trial, thereby introducing bias. This 
creates a challenge in interpreting results, but the child’s primary 
caregiver at the time is likely to be the best person to report on the 
child’s health and development. </p><p>Children are allocated randomly 
into GIFT or FACS, and while birth siblings will all be allocated to the
 same intervention, this will not be possible for nonsiblings placed in 
the same foster care home. If both birth families and foster families 
were allocated to the same intervention then this would lead to 
significant clustering effects; that is, potentially large groups of 
children (e.g., a large birth sibship spread across several foster homes
 and all the associated foster sibships) could require randomisation 
together creating imbalances. Consequently, some foster carers may have 
children in their care going through both the GIFT and FACS assessments 
which has the potential to introduce contamination.</p><h4>Acknowledgments</h4><p>The
