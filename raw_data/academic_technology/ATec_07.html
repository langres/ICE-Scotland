       <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Dance Dance Revolution is a pioneering exergame which has attracted considerable interest for its potential to promote regular exercise and its associated health benefits. The advent of a range of different consumer body motion tracking video game console peripherals raises the question whether their different technological affordances (i.e., variations in the type and number of body limbs that they can track) influence the user experience while playing dance-based exergames both in terms of the level of physical exertion and the nature of the play experience. To investigate these issues a group of subjects performed a total of six comparable dance routines selected from commercial dance-based exergames (two routines from each game) on three different consoles. The subjects&amp;#x2019; level of physical exertion was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption and heart rate. They also reported their perceived level of exertion, difficulty, and enjoyment ratings after completing each dance routine. No differences were found in the physiological measures of exertion between the peripherals/consoles. However, there were significant variations in the difficulty and enjoyment ratings between peripherals. The design implications of these results are discussed including the tension between helping to guide and coordinate player movement versus offering greater movement flexibility." />

 Dance Revolution is a pioneering exergame which has attracted 
considerable interest for its potential to promote regular exercise and 
its associated health benefits. The advent of a range of different 
consumer body motion tracking video game console peripherals raises the 
question whether their different technological affordances (i.e., 
variations in the type and number of body limbs that they can track) 
influence the user experience while playing dance-based exergames both 
in terms of the level of physical exertion and the nature of the play 
experience. To investigate these issues a group of subjects performed a 
total of six comparable dance routines selected from commercial 
dance-based exergames (two routines from each game) on three different 
consoles. The subjects’ level of physical exertion was assessed by 
measuring oxygen consumption and heart rate. They also reported their 
perceived level of exertion, difficulty, and enjoyment ratings after 
completing each dance routine. No differences were found in the 
physiological measures of exertion between the peripherals/consoles. 
However, there were significant variations in the difficulty and 
enjoyment ratings between peripherals. The design implications of these 
results are discussed including the tension between helping to guide and
 coordinate player movement versus offering greater movement 
flexibility.</p><span class="end-abs"></span><h4 id="sec1">1. Introduction</h4><p>Exercise
 involving dancing to music is a popular form of physical activity and 
from the arcade beginnings of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), dance-based 
exergames (i.e., video games that use body movement to control them and 
require physical exertion to play them) have now become a popular 
mainstream activity [<a href="#B1">1</a>]. Over the years a variety of 
different body-movement-based video game controllers have been developed
 to try to create more immersive video game play experiences. With the 
advent of many different types of low cost sensor devices, this trend is
 likely to continue. More recently, three different consumer body motion
 sensor peripherals for consumer video games consoles have come to the 
fore and attracted considerable interest (i.e., Nintendo Wiimote, Sony 
Playstation Move, and Microsoft Kinect) for their potential to open up 
new possibilities for body-movement-controlled video games. Given their 
growing popularity and broad age and demographic appeal, there is now 
significant interest in their potential to promote physical activity and
 health [<a href="#B2">2</a>–<a href="#B4">4</a>] rather than just 
simply a novel form of game controller, and exergames have already been 
incorporated into physical education activities in schools [<a href="#B5">5</a>, <a href="#B6">6</a>].</p><p>A low level of physical fitness is an important risk factor for premature mortality [<a href="#B7">7</a>].
 Despite the unequivocal health benefits of regular exercise, physical 
inactivity is a major health problem globally and has a wide range of 
health problems associated with it including high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and some 
cancers [<a href="#B8">8</a>]. In England, UK in 2008, health statistics
 indicate that 17% boys and 15% girls between the ages of 2 and 15 years
 were classified as being obese along with a quarter of men and women 
aged 16 and over [<a href="#B9">9</a>]. The UK government’s recommended 
amount of physical activity for children is at least 60 minutes of 
moderate intensity activity on every day of the week and for adults at 
least 30 minutes per day of moderate intensity exercise on five or more 
days of the week [<a href="#B10">10</a>]. Recent data for England 
indicate that between the ages of 2 and 15 years, only a third of boys 
achieved this target for physical activity compared with a quarter of 
girls and only 39% men and 29% women reached the minimum recommended 
amount [<a href="#B9">9</a>].</p><p>Given the meteoric rise of video 
games to become a very popular form of entertainment, they are not 
something that can easily be ignored. While “<i>all things in moderation</i>”
 is a good maxim to live by, it is more realistic and pragmatic to tap 
into the engaging nature of video games and steer players towards 
becoming healthier by replacing a proportion of their sedentary game 
play time with active games that require significant physical exertion [<a href="#B11">11</a>]. It is perhaps unsurprising that making physical activity more enjoyable has been shown to increase participation [<a href="#B12">12</a>].</p><p>DDR
 is based on a game controller which comprises a simple set of foot 
switches arranged in a 3 × 3 matrix on a pad that is approximately 0.8 m
 × 0.8 m in size. The game requires the player to step on the correct 
arrow on the dance pad in time with on-screen visual arrow cues, and 
points are awarded depending on how accurately the player times each 
step and for accumulating sequences of correct steps. Increasing the 
speed at which the arrows appear on the screen and the complexity of the
 arrow sequences makes the game harder and requires higher levels of 
motor skill and more rapid physical movement to perform. One of the 
first studies to assess the level of energy expenditure associated with 
playing DDR [<a href="#B13">13</a>] (by measuring rates of oxygen 
consumption) reported levels of exertion that would meet the lower end 
of the intensity range of the American College of Sports Medicine’s 
guidelines for aerobic exercise [<a href="#B14">14</a>]. A further study of DDR, this time in children [<a href="#B15">15</a>],
 had similar findings. When comparing experienced DDR players with 
beginners they found that the experienced players could play the game at
 a higher skill level and this led to greater levels of energy 
expenditure [<a href="#B16">16</a>]. An international online survey of 
DDR players found that the main reasons people played the game was 
because it was fun, provided some form of exercise, and was something 
challenging to do [<a href="#B17">17</a>]. Finally, it has recently been reported that a suitably modified form of DDR could be used by older adults (70+ years old) [<a href="#B18">18</a>].</p><p>From
 a health perspective, the higher the level of physical exertion 
required to play an exergame, the greater the benefits that are likely 
to accrue. The arrival of dance-based exergames based on body motion 
sensing peripherals is therefore of significant interest in that they 
may have the potential to facilitate the desired higher levels of energy
 expenditure. However, because the various peripherals differ in the 
number of limbs that they track (and therefore the amount of active 
skeletal muscle mass), it is possible that they differ in their 
potential health benefits. The Wiimote (Nintendo) peripheral 
incorporates a triaxial accelerometer to detect motion and an optical 
sensor that enables the determination of where on the screen the 
controller is pointing to. The Playstation Move (Sony) peripheral 
incorporates both a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial angular rate
 sensor and a magnetometer to correct for drift. A ball mounted on the 
end of the controller and illuminated from the inside by coloured LEDs 
is tracked by a camera mounted above the screen, and given that the size
 of the ball is known, it can be tracked in three dimensions. Finally, 
the Kinect (Microsoft) peripheral is entirely camera-based and uses an 
infrared 3D depth scanning approach to motion tracking.</p><p>The first 
aim of this study was therefore to assess whether there were any 
influences of the different body motion tracking technologies on the 
levels of energy expenditure elicited while playing dance-based 
exergames as determined by direct measurement of oxygen consumption. The
 second aim was to assess if the technologies differed in the nature of 
the user experiences while playing the games in terms of perceived 
levels of physical exertion, game difficulty, and enjoyment ratings.</p><h4 id="sec2">2. Methods</h4><p>Subjects
 were recruited from within the student population at Heriot-Watt 
University. All participants gave written, informed consent and 
completed a health screening questionnaire. The study was subject to 
local ethics committee approval. Subjects’ height and body mass were 
measured using a portable stadiometer (Holtain, Pembrokeshire, UK), and 
weighing scales (Seca 761, Birmingham, UK) respectively. In total, 11 
subjects (9 male) were recruited and completed the study. Mean (±SD) age

consoles (Nintendo Wii, Sony Playstation 3, and Microsoft Xbox 360) and,
 their separate associated body motion sensing technologies (as 
described in the Introduction) were used in the study. The exergames 
used in the study were Just Dance 2 (Ubisoft Entertainment), SingStar + 
Dance (Sony), and Dance Central (Harmonix) and for the Wii, Playstation 
3, and Xbox 360 consoles, respectively. Six songs/dance routines (two 
from each game) were selected for use in study on the basis that the 
routines were all of similar tempo (beats per minute) and involved 
comparable amounts of arm and leg movements. The routines selected were 
as follows: Microsoft Kinect– “<i>Just Dance</i>” by <i>Lady Gaga</i> (Kinect1) and “<i>Drop It Like It’s Hot</i>” by <i>Snoop Dogg</i> (Kinect2); Sony Playstation Move– “<i>U Can’t Touch This</i>” by <i>MC Hammer</i> (Move1), and “<i>It’s Like That</i>” by <i>Run-Dmc</i> Vs. <i>Jason Nevins</i> (Move2); Nintendo Wii– “<i>The Power</i>” by <i>Snap</i>! (Wii1) and “<i>Hey Ya</i>!” by <i>Outkast</i> (Wii2).

the game play periods were assessed using a wearable, wireless 
telemetric recording system (Oxycon Mobile, VIASYS Healthcare, 
Hoechberg, Germany). Subjects wear a face mask and expired air flow is 
measured with a turbine impropeller and is simultaneously analysed for 
oxygen and carbon dioxide fractional concentrations. These measurements 
are then cross-product integrated on a breath-by-breath basis to 
determine the rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.
 Before each testing session, the expired air flow sensor was calibrated
 using two separate flow rates according to the manufacturer’s 
specifications and the gas analysers calibrated using a precision gas 
mixture. The gas analysis unit and the combined battery pack and radio 
transmitter unit are both held in place by a harness worn on the 
subject’s back with virtually no restriction on movement. Subjects also 
wore a heart rate monitor chest strap (Polar, Kempele, Finland) under 
their clothing, the signal from which is automatically picked up by the 
telemetric system. Physiological data were averaged over the duration of
 each game play period.</p><p>Immediately after completing each dance 
routine, participants completed three simple psychophysiological 
self-report measures. The first measure involved rating their perceived 
level of physical exertion using a numerical scale [<a href="#B19">19</a>]
 (i.e., how hard a subject felt they were exercising). The second 
measure concerned how difficult subjects perceived each routine and used
 a visual analogue scale (VAS) comprising of a 100 mm line anchored with
 the labels “<i>Very Easy</i>” at one end and “<i>Very Difficult</i>” at the other with subjects asked to make a mark somewhere along the line [<a href="#B20">20</a>].
 The third and final self-report measure related to the level of 
enjoyment the subjects experienced also used a VAS; this time anchored 
by the labels “<i>Very Enjoyable</i>” and “<i>Very Boring</i>.”</p><p>The
 familiarisation session involved the subjects being introduced to the 
body motion sensing peripherals and the two selected dance routines on 
each of the three games consoles. Both the order of the consoles and the
 order in which each subject played each pair of routines were 
randomised. To help familiarise the subjects with the corresponding 
sensations of physical exertion used in the self-report measure (as 
described above), immediately after the end of each routine the subjects
 were asked to rate their perceived level of exertion. After completing 
each pair routines on a given console, subjects had a short (five 
minutes) seated rest break to permit the equipment to be changed over to
 the next console.</p><p>In the measurement session, subjects were 
fitted with the telemetric physiological recording system (as described 
earlier) and wore it throughout the session. Subjects were seated, and 
baseline measurements taken for five minutes before the first game was 
played. All dance routines were played once except for the Xbox 360 
games (Kinect1 &amp; Kinect2) which were played twice because of their 
shorter duration in order for the game play time to be similar across 
all consoles. The order and timing of the routines were the same as for 
the familiarisation session and immediately after the end of each 
routine the subjects completed each of the self-report measures.</p><p>All
 data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data 
were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance except for

 of this study were that while the three different consumer body motion 
sensors differ in the underlying technologies, and therefore the type 
and number of body limbs they are able to track the motion of, the 
separate dance-based exergames developed for each video game console all
 required comparable amounts of physical exertion (equivalent to 
moderate exercise) to play them. However, while the perceived level of 
physical exertion that the subjects reported after completing each of 
the routines were comparable, the games were rated differently by the 
subjects in their levels of difficulty and this appeared to influence 
the level of enjoyment that they experienced.</p><p>Dance-based 
exergames normally comprise of a range of different songs and associated
 routines. The routines selected for use in the current study were 
selected on the basis that they all were at similar tempos and all 
involved comparable amounts of arm and leg movements. The results are 
somewhat surprising in that it was expected that routines using the 
Microsoft Kinect peripheral would elicit from the subjects more body 
movement during game play compared to the other two peripherals. This 
was because of its full body motion tracking capability compared to the 
more limited tracking of only one arm by the other two peripherals. The 
absence of an observed difference in the measured rates of oxygen 
consumption between peripherals tends to suggest that the technological 
differences between the three body motion sensing peripherals do not 
matter in this regard. Furthermore, the measured rates of oxygen 
consumption in this study are comparable to previously published studies
 of dance-based exergames using original foot-switch game controllers [<a href="#B13">13</a>, <a href="#B15">15</a>, <a href="#B21">21</a>].</p><p>It
 has previously been suggested that interactive forms of exercise may 
provide a degree of distraction from the sensations of exertional 
discomfort [<a href="#B22">22</a>], which would be a significant benefit, particularly if the player is unaccustomed to exercising. It has already been shown [<a href="#B20">20</a>] that a variety of different exergames can promote a flow state experience [<a href="#B23">23</a>]
 that is in fact closer to sport than exercise because of the 
challenge-based nature of video game play. However, this issue has not 
been specifically investigated in relation to dance-based exergames. It 
is therefore of interest to consider whether the results of the present 
study show any evidence of distraction from the sensations of physical 
exertion. The numerical rating of perceived exertion scale has been 
designed and validated so that the values (reduced by a factor of 10) 
correspond reasonably closely to heart rate [<a href="#B19">19</a>]. 
Thus, if dance-based exergames were also to provide a degree of 
distraction, then the mean ratings of perceived exertion values shown in
 Figure <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2013/603604/fig4/">4</a> would be expected to be lower, given the magnitude of the mean heart rates reported in Figure <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2013/603604/fig2/">2</a>.
 Rather, the ratings of perceived exertion values are a little higher 
than might be expected for traditional forms of exercise at a comparable
 intensity. One possible explanation is that the significant involvement
 of the arms in the dance routines might have given the subjects the 
impression that the exercise was of a higher overall intensity than it 
actually was. Such a situation could arise since the arms have 
proportionally smaller skeletal muscle mass compared to the legs and 
therefore may be working at a higher metabolic rate. A further possible 
explanation for this observation is that the dance-based exergames 
require the player to focus specifically on rhythmically coordinating 
the movements of their limbs and this increased need for conscious 
proprioceptive awareness resulted in a greater instead of a 
lesser-perceived level of exertion.</p><p>Game developers are well 
versed in the need to pay careful attention to the balance of challenge 
versus player skill balance in order to present them with a meaningful 
challenge [<a href="#B24">24</a>]. However, the results of the other 
self-report measures indicate that while the difficulty and enjoyment 
ratings of each pair of dance routine games on the same console were 
comparable, there were significant differences in the ratings between 
the various consoles (Figures <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2013/603604/fig5/">5</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2013/603604/fig6/">6</a>). Furthermore, the correlation analysis presented in Figure <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2013/603604/fig7/">7</a>
 suggests that the games that were perceived to be easier were also the 
ones that the subjects reported as being more enjoyable and conversely 
higher levels of perceived difficulty were associated with reduced 
levels of enjoyment. There are several potential reasons that may 
account at least in part for these observed differences. The first is 
that there were significant differences between the games (and therefore
 peripherals) in the level of motor skill required to play them. The 
second is that the games differed in their thresholds of acceptability 
for timing accuracy of a player’s movements. The third potential reason 
is that the body motion tracking peripherals differ in their underlying 
technologies and affordances and as a consequence vary in the type and 
number of limbs that they can track. The Kinect peripheral, by virtue of
 being able to track all four limbs, is best placed to potentially help 
guide and coordinate player movement. In contrast, the movement of a 
single arm detected by the Wiimote peripheral is only responsive to 
changes in relative rather than absolute position. As a consequence, the
 tracked arm is unlikely to need to follow such precise trajectories in 
space; moreover the player will also have considerable freedom of 
movement in their nontracked limbs. Finally, the Playstation Move 
peripheral by spatially tracking the absolute position of the motion of 
the player’s arm requires greater spatial precision of movement, but the
 absence of any detection of lower limb movement means that it is less 
able to guide and coordinate player movement. Unfortunately it is not 
possible to make a clear distinction between these potential 
explanations outlined above. However, it does seem unlikely that any of 
the three games used in the current study would intentionally be 
designed to be significantly more difficult at the beginner level, given
 that they will have been subject to extensive play-testing. Instead, it
 seems more likely that the subjects found the games, that either more 
fully tracked and guided their movements, or permitted significant 
movement freedom, to be more enjoyable compared to the games that 
closely tracked a single limb (arm) but at the same time gave less 
overall feedback. This interplay between the degree of movement 
precision required and the nature and extent of the feedback given to a 
player is an important issue that needs to more fully investigated in 
order to help inform the design of future exergames.</p><p>In terms of 
the potential to promote health benefits, it is likely that most players
 who encounter dance-based exergames in social or physical education 
settings will do so at beginner or possibly intermediate skill levels 
and that considerable amounts of practice will be required to progress 
beyond these levels. Thus, from a health perspective, it would be highly
 desirable for dance-based exergames to be designed such that, even at 
beginner to intermediate skill levels, the games maximise the amount and
 intensity of body movement while at the same time providing an 
enjoyable and engaging game play experience. It is however recognised 
that this would not necessarily be an easy outcome to achieve. The most 
likely way in which this might be achieved would be to steer game 
progression towards increasing step rates coupled with less of an 
emphasis on increasing the complexity of moves (i.e., faster repetitive 
movement instead of greater complexity). It is probable that such an 
approach will also need some adjustment (reduction) in the temporal 
accuracy requirements for movements to be scored (at least at less 
advanced skill levels). Finally, the initial skill demands should be set
 at a very low level to make a game as widely accessible as possible and
 straightforward for players to follow, and the game should be carefully
 structured in a way that effectively facilitates player motor skill 
development and progression.</p><h4 id="sec5">5. Conclusion</h4><p>The 
results of this study suggest that while the three different body motion
 sensor peripherals differ in their underlying technologies and 
affordances, contrary to what was expected, they do not appear to differ
 in the amount of physical exertion they facilitate when used to 
incorporate body movement into dance-based exergames. However, based on 
the self-reports measures from the subjects, there appear to be 
differences in the game play experiences that they offer. While the 
reasons for this remain unclear and warrant further investigation, there
 is one particular issue that has been highlighted and is of major 
importance. Specifically, it is the relative influences on game play 
experience of whole body motion tracking that is able to more 
holistically guide and support player movement versus restricted limb 
motion tracking that is agnostic to the movement of nontracked limbs and
 therefore as a consequence offers players greater freedom of movement. 
Finally, the potential commercial and health benefits of widespread 
adoption and sustained use of dance-based exergames are significant. 
There is, therefore, also a need to investigate the factors that help to
 sustain long-term playing of dance-based exergames and how these might 
be optimised, if these benefits are to be realised.</p></div></div><div class="xml-content"><h4>References</h4>
