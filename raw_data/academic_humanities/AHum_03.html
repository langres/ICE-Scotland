	<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="The term spirituality is notoriously difficult to define, as is evidenced by the discussions  between contemporary sociologists of religion. If there are any central elements to such a definition, they revolve around the search for the sacred, and the view that certain practices  or beliefs lead to humans being placed in a position of privileged access to the transcendent  dimension. Often such spiritual experiences and insights are the result of practices that seek  deeper communication with the divine, or stem from contemplative reflection upon one’s purpose in a broader context of universal ontology. This discussion seeks to probe Q for its understanding of spirituality, both in terms of the way the text promotes communication with the divine, as well as offering heightened spiritual experience for adherents to its teaching. In essence, this is an exploration of the way the new religious movement reflected in Q offered its followers contact with the transcendent within the context of everyday human life.">

<p>The term spirituality is notoriously difficult to define, as is 
evidenced by the discussions between contemporary sociologists of 
religion. If there are any central elements to such a definition, they 
revolve around the search for the sacred, and the view that certain 
practices or beliefs lead to humans being placed in a position of 
privileged access to the transcendent dimension. Often such spiritual 
experiences and insights are the result of practices that seek deeper 
communication with the divine, or stem from contemplative reflection 
upon one’s purpose in a broader context of universal ontology. This 
discussion seeks to probe Q for its understanding of spirituality, both 
in terms of the way the text promotes communication with the divine, as 
well as offering heightened spiritual experience for adherents to its 
teaching. In essence, this is an exploration of the way the new 
religious movement reflected in Q offered its followers contact with the
 transcendent within the context of everyday human life.</p>

<p>Approaching the Q document using the abstract and etic term 
‘spirituality’ may evoke concerns of anachronism. It is indeed true that
 the term ‘spirituality’ or semantically equivalent Greek terms are not 
to be found in the reconstructed Q document. In fact, perhaps the 
closest related conceptual term in the New Testament is πνευματικός, 
which does not denote the abstract idea of ‘spirituality’, but is an 
adjectival descriptor that portrays people or objects as being 
‘spiritual’. It is primarily a Pauline term, occurring 25 times in the 
Pauline corpus,<a href="#FN0001_2888"><sup>1</sup></a> and twice in 1 Peter and once in Revelation.<a href="#FN0002_2888"><sup>2</sup></a>
 Notwithstanding the fact that the closest related term does not occur 
in gospel literature, applying the modern idea of spirituality to an 
ancient text such as Q can cast into sharper relief some aspects of that
 text which might otherwise be overlooked. Admittedly, caution is 
required to ensure that the text is not pressed into modern categories 
that are foreign to it.</p>
<p>In the discourse surrounding the study of religion, ‘spirituality’ 
has become a common way of referring to the experience of the divine 
either within a religious movement, or to denote the sense of the 
transcendent outside of formal religious settings. Whilst this may 
encapsulate part of the broad sense of the term, an agreed or accurate 
definition is notoriously difficult. One of the attractions of new 
religious movements is that they promise fresh experiences of the 
divine, and are often seen by adherents as repristinating institutional 
religions, especially when the sense of direct contact with the 
transcendent has been domesticated by formal mediation. Such newfound 
religious commitment can rekindle the sense of spiritual vitality and 
the experience of the immediacy of the transcendent. As part of the 
earliest literary strata of the nascent Jesus movement, the Q document 
is a textual product of such a new religious movement. It is therefore 
interesting to explore the document's strategy in addressing its readers
 to comprehend the manner in which it offers authentic contact with the 
divine, perhaps with the concomitant critique of existing religious 
institutions. Therefore, in this discussion a broad definition of 
spirituality will be adopted in line with the approach of most 
sociologists of religion. Hence, the spirituality of the Q document will
 be determined through its insights into experiencing contact with the 
transcendent or divine, and by probing the claim of more immediate 
religious experience.</p>
<p>It is necessary to return to the definitional issue to gain more 
traction on what is being investigated. As has been noted, the 
definition of ‘spirituality’ is notoriously contested and has been 
understood differently within various religious or non-religious 
settings. A general definition is open-ended, with the following being 
representative of the broad contours of what is typically understood by 
the term spirituality:
</p>
<blockquote><p>[…] a transcendent dimension within human experience. 
This dimension is discovered in moments in which the individual 
questions the meaning of personal existence and attempts to place the 
self within a broader ontological context. (Shfranske &amp; Gorsuch <a href="#CIT0023_2888">1984</a>:231)</p></blockquote>
<p>Within the broad framework of Christian understanding, it is widely 
held ‘that the study of spirituality appropriately involves a focus on 
“experience.” Although there is no final consensus on what “experience” 
means or how it can best be studied’ (Holder <a href="#CIT0011_2888">2007</a>:2).
 However, most modern approaches to Christian spirituality have noted 
that the object of study is not simply a series of discrete or ecstatic 
events, but an ongoing existential phenomenon. Consequently, recent 
definitions have tended to emphasise the continuous nature of the 
experience under examination. Thus, Schneiders suggests that:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Spirituality is the actualization of the basic human 
capacity for transcendence […] the experience of conscious involvement 
in the project of life-integration through self-transcendence towards 
the horizon of ultimate value one perceives. (Schneiders <a href="#CIT0021_2888">2007</a>:16)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the discussion that follows, spirituality and the concept of 
religious experience will be understood broadly. Thus, the purpose of 
the discussion is to understand the perceived experiential benefits that

in Q to maintain their religious commitment in the face of real or

<p>The theme of spirituality or religious experience is nowhere 
discussed in Q. Instead it is necessary to examine the material 
contained in the text to uncover what it was that enabled Q disciples to
 maintain their commitment to this new and liminal religious movement. 
That commitment stood in the face of persecution and ostracism (Q 
6.22–6.23), whether perceived or real. Given that opposition, there must
 have been strong benefits, which Q disciples perceived to outweigh the 
hostility and alienation that was directed at them from members of the 
larger Jewish religious movement that did not accept the message of 
Jesus (Cromhout <a href="#CIT0004_2888">2007</a>:304–306).<a href="#FN0003_2888"><sup>3</sup></a>
 By probing individual texts, it is hoped to identify positive aspects 
of the religious commitment to the teachings of Jesus. After these 
benefits have been identified, the discussion will seek to identify any 
common themes that might stand at the core of the spirituality or 
religious experiences that the Q document offers to those who adhere to 
its teachings.</p>
<font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="5"></a><b>The promise of the spirit in John’s preaching (Q 3.16b)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Within the reconstructed text of the Q document<a href="#FN0004_2888"><sup>4</sup></a>
 the first promise of encountering the divine occurs in the preaching of
 John the Baptist. The Baptist pronounces the arrival of the ‘coming 
one’, and announces that this figure ‘will baptize you in the holy 
spirit and fire’ (Q 3.16b). The images of baptism and fire speak of 
purification, especially to an audience familiar with Jewish practices 
of lustrations for ritual purity, and burnt offerings to atone for sins.
 As Valantasis (<a href="#CIT0025_2888">2005</a>:48) observes, ‘[<i>t</i>]he
 person and the community must be made sacred by purification […] the 
wind/fire/spirit baptism indicates an incremental but complete 
transformation’. However, the purificatory rite is no longer 
institutionally administered, but is achieved through direct contact 
with the Holy Spirit. Within the Hebrew Bible, the spirit comes upon, or
 is poured out on those uniquely designated to speak or act for the Lord
 (i.e. Jdg 13.25; Is 11.2; Ezk 11.5). Here a democratisation of the 
experience of direct contact with the divine is promised for those who 
undergo the baptism of the coming one (Foster <a href="#CIT0008_2888">2008</a>:81–91).<a href="#FN0005_2888"><sup>5</sup></a>
 At this stage in the timeframe of Q, this promise of encounter with the
 divine lies in the eschatological future, with the coming one bringing 
the Holy Spirit, which is the agent of God's eschatological salvation.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="6"></a><b>The Q beatitudes (Q 6.20–6.23)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Possession of the kingdom of God is promised to the poor. This 
existential reversal envisages the dispossessed of this world becoming 
central figures in the kingly reign of God. Although some have 
understood the statement ‘the kingdom of God <i>is</i> yours’ to be a proleptic present (Davies &amp; Allison <a href="#CIT0005_2888">1998</a>:445–447), it is better understood as reflecting the realised eschatology of Q (Fleddermann <a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:324).
 God's kingdom is mentioned 13 times elsewhere in Q (Q 7.28; 10.9; 
11.2b, 20, 52; 12.31; 13.18, 20, 29; 16.16; 17.20, 21 [twice]). There is
 a tension between future and realised aspects of the kingdom. In the 
Lord's Prayer that calls for the kingdom of God to come has a clear 
future orientation, but even here, it is a future that that can be 
inaugurated through the prayers of the faithful. By contrast, the 
present perspective on the presence of the kingdom is seen through 
Jesus’ work as an exorcist: ‘but if it is by the finger of God that I 
cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you’ (Q 11.20). 
In both that context and here in Q 6.20 God's reign is something that 
breaks into the present reality of followers of Jesus, because he 
heralds in the eschatological power of God.</p>
<p>It is often noted that in the reconstructed sequence of Q, the first 
beatitude follows the final temptation (Q 4.5–4.8) where the devil 
offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world. In contrast to this 
temptation to possess earthly dominion and authority, Jesus promises the
 poor that their liminal status already means that they have a place in 
the heavenly kingdom. Thus, there is an inversion between material 
experience and spiritual status, thus privileging the socially marginal.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="7"></a><b>Love of enemies (Q 6.27–6.28, 35c–35d)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Alongside poverty, suffering is promised as being the route that 
leads to a familial relationship with God. Q believers are exhorted to 
‘pray for those who persecute you, that you may become sons of your 
father’ (Q 6.28, 6.35c). The experience of the divine is expressed in 
terms of relationship. This suggests a permanence of the spiritual 
dimension that is promised in the Q document, which is not a transitory 
or ephemeral encounter with the deity. Love of enemies (Q 6.27) and 
praying for persecutors (6.28) are actions that are best understood as 
emulating the behaviour of God (Nolland <a href="#CIT0017_2888">1989</a>:300).<a href="#FN0006_2888"><sup>6</sup></a>
 Hence, followers of Jesus demonstrate their filial relationship with 
God by replicating the same behaviour as the deity. Through acting like 
God, they are drawn into relationship with him as his children. It is in
 this manner, as God's children, that Q believers are seen as having an 
intimate experience of the transcendent.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="8"></a><b>God’s revelation to children (Q 10.21–10.24)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Jesus’ thanksgiving to the ‘Father, Lord of heaven and earth’ in Q 
10.21 centres upon the belief that God has kept hidden certain things 
from those who are viewed as being wise, and instead he has disclosed 
these hidden things to those described as ‘children’ (Q 10.21). Contact 
with the divine is not purely a sensory experience of followers of 
Jesus; it is also a pedagogical phenomenon whereby such disciples 
receive revelation that is withheld from those who are not privileged as
 recipients of divinely disclosed information.</p>
<p>This Q speech continues by explaining that in order to become a 
recipient of divine revelation, one must have the father made known 
through the son. In a sequential series of revelatory acts, it is 
declared that the father alone knows the son, and in a reciprocal 
manner, the son alone knows the father. What might be an impenetrable 
circle of knowledge of the divine is broken open, since in the final 
clause this knowledge of the father is not limited exclusively to the 
son (Nolland <a href="#CIT0018_2888">1993</a>:575).<a href="#FN0007_2888"><sup>7</sup></a> Rather it is extended ‘to whomever the son chooses to reveal him’ (Q 10.22). Thus as Fleddermann (<a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:448) observes, ‘[<i>t</i>]he
 first speech emphasizes the Father's desire to communicate his 
revelation to small children (v. 21d) and the Son's desire to reveal the
 Father (v. 22d.)’. Therefore, this statement in Q reflects the divine 
desire for revelation to humanity, as well as explaining the chosen 
method – disclosure through the son who has privileged knowledge of the 
father.</p>
<p>The experience of the transcendent is further portrayed in this 
section through the statement made in the following makarism: ‘blessed 
are the eyes that see what you see’ (Q 10.23). Here the eyes of 
believers are blessed because they have seen the revelation of God 
described in the previous two verses. The act of seeing has a double 
function in this context. It refers both to the viewing of Jesus’ signs 
and miracles, but at a deeper level it describes the spiritual 
perception of Q believers who have the insight to apprehend the 
significance of such signs. Hence, the miracles of Jesus, according to 
Q, constitute the locus for revelation if they are understood as 
revealing Jesus as the son who can make the father known, and at the 
same time, they function to draw those with such perception into a 
filial relationship with God. Therefore, Q's spirituality is centred 
upon discerning the status of Jesus, and acknowledging him to be the 
medium through whom the father is known.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="9"></a><b>Answer to prayer (Q 11.9–11.13)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Prayer is a significant theme in Q. Having given the example of the 
Lord's Prayer, Q immediately follows this model prayer with a basic 
theology of the role of intercession in the life of believers. In 
describing divine response to petitionary prayer, the Q saying makes a 
comparative argument. The reasoning is that if earthly fathers know how 
to give good gifts to their children, then ‘how much more will the 
father from heaven give good things to those who ask him’ (Q 11.9). This
 is a type of the Jewish <i>qal wahomer</i> argument that reasons from 
the lesser case to the greater by using the precedent established from 
the generally accepted lesser example. Therefore, access to God and 
trust in the responsive provision of his fatherly generosity are key to 
Q's understanding of the spiritual blessings that its religionists will 
receive.</p>
<p>Once again, the perspective of Q is that those who enjoy a special 
familial type relationship with God as children of the heavenly father 
receive the privilege of divine response to prayer (Davies &amp; Allison
 <a href="#CIT0005_2888">1998</a>:684). These verses also reflect the 
centrality of prayer in the spiritual life promoted by Q. No doubt, the 
role of prayer in religious life was not an innovation on the part of 
the author of Q or even of Jesus as he is characterised in that 
document. Instead, it was part of wider Jewish spirituality. 
Nevertheless, the intimacy of prayer language is characteristic of the 
early Jesus movement, with God portrayed as the archetypal paternal 
figure who delights in providing for his offspring (Fleddermann <a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:473, n. 252).<a href="#FN0008_2888"><sup>8</sup></a>
 In this way, a spiritual kinship is established between the believers 
addressed in Q and a divine figure, which becomes immanent rather than 
transcendent. It is this access to God, and the sense that the deity is 
approachable that stands at the heart of the spirituality of Q, and 
illustrates one of the benefits that adherents to this movement felt 
that they enjoyed. Valantasis suggests that what is outlined here 
corresponded to contemporary cultural models of the household, but that 
this has been spiritualised into a theological portrayal of the new 
divine family relationship. Thus he states, ‘[<i>t</i>]he community of 
followers have become God's family, and the paterfamilias of the family 
God, will provide appropriate and good responses to God's children's 
requests’ (Valantasis <a href="#CIT0025_2888">2005</a>:123).</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="10"></a><b>More precious than sparrows (Q 12.6–12.7)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>A new sense of worth is instilled in believers through the 
proclamation in Q that the God who cares even about the life of a 
seemingly insignificant sparrow lavishes far more concern on those who 
are addressed here in Q. The promise of Q 12.7 is twofold. First 
believers are assured that even the hairs of their head are numbered, 
and secondly that God cares for them to a far greater extent than 
sparrows: ‘but even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be 
afraid, you are worth more than many sparrows’ (Q 12.7). This saying 
follows from the stark statement about fear. Adherents to the Jesus 
movement are told not to be fearful of those opponents who are perceived
 to have the ability to destroy earthly bodies (Q 12.4): rather, they 
are to fear God who has power over both the body and the soul (Q 12.5). 
The positive side of this perspective is not fear of God, but the more 
gentle aspect of his relationship with faithful believers. The followers
 of Jesus are reassured of the care of God for all who remain steadfast 
in their discipleship with the touching words concerning their worth in 
the sight of God and the portrayal of his deep care (Q 12.7).</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="11"></a><b>Lives free from anxiety (Q 12.22b–12.31)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>The same theme as the saying on sparrows is found in this complex of 
sayings that use the ornithological example of ravens and the botanical 
example of lilies. The emphasis is on living lives free from anxiety in 
the sure knowledge that the father knows the needs of believers and 
responds by providing for those needs (Q 12.30). The striking comparison
 with the beauty of the lilies climaxes with the promise to believers 
concerning God's care: ‘will he not much more clothe you, people of 
little faith’ (Q 12.28). These examples from creation reveal an active 
and sustaining deity who is engaged in provision. From this, believers 
are expected to draw lessons pertinent to their own security knowing 
that God likewise will provide for them. Given this certainty, disciples
 are called upon to direct their attention elsewhere, rather than to 
have concern for earthly sustenance and provision. Therefore, according 
to Q the appropriate focus for believers is to ‘seek his kingdom’ then 
consequently, ‘all these things will be added to you’ (Q 12.31). The 
series of exhortations that have counselled disciples to trust that God 
will respond to prayer (Q 11.13), to know one's value is greater than 
that of the sparrows for whom God cares (Q 12.6–12.7), and to learn from
 nature to live anxiety-free lives (Q 12.22b–12.30) concludes by 
refocusing attention on the kingdom, rather than on the self 
(Fleddermann <a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:615–616). Responding to 
the demands of God's kingdom not only helps believers to desist from 
worry, but by doing this they are also reassured that their human needs 
will be divinely met. Thus, in terms of the spirituality of Q there is a
 clear belief that religious devotion and commitment to God will not 
detract from the provision of human needs. Here the author of Q sets up a
 hierarchy of attachments: ‘Attachment to the God of heaven manifests 
itself in an absence of attachment to the things of earth’ (Bock <a href="#CIT0002_2888">1996</a>:1168).
 Therefore, the spiritual agenda of Q requires a shift of focus away 
from one's needs, and instead requires contemplation of God's purposes.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="12"></a><b>Reclining in the Kingdom (Q 13.29, 13.28)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Whilst Q presents many benefits for believers in the present life in 
terms of their spiritual experience of the divine, it is not devoid of 
future hope. That future hope is primarily focused on an even closer 
communion and relationship with God than that which disciples experience
 in their present lives. That Q has a future eschatology cannot be 
doubted given the apocalyptic motifs especially in Q 17.22–17.37, and Q 
12.39–12.46. The so-called apocalyptic discourse of Q 17.22–17.37 
focuses on the coming day of the Son of Man, which is viewed as a time 
of apocalyptic judgement. If one can construct an eschatological 
chronology in Q, then the double saying of Q 13.29, 13.28 reflects a 
period after the coming of the Son of Man when the faithful have been 
gathered into the kingdom, but those who assumed they had a privileged 
position are cast out to a place of ‘outer darkness’. As Tuckett (<a href="#CIT0024_2888">1996</a>:400)
 notes, this material functions, as ‘one of the warnings to Israel with 
accompanying threats that Gentiles will replace Jews in the kingdom’.</p>
<p>As it is typically reconstructed, following the Matthean ordering of 
the two elements in this double saying, the promise of partaking in the 
eschatological kingdom precedes the warning of exclusion:<a href="#FN0009_2888"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>And many</i>] will come from the east and west and recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God, but [<i>you will be</i>] cast [<i>into the</i>] out[<i>er darkness</i>], where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. (Q 13.29, 13.28)<a href="#FN0010_2888"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In Q, this saying is followed by a judgement oracle on Jerusalem, 
which speaks both of the rejection of the prophets and announces the 
desolation of the temple: ‘behold, your house is forsaken’ (Q 
13.34–13.35). Therefore, Q comments on institutional religion, which it 
portrays as unable to respond positively to the prophetic messengers 
sent by God. In its stead Q offers a spirituality that envisages a 
closer relationship with the divine both in the present life, and in the
 eschatological age. It portrays an eschatological banquet in which all 
the nations may participate. Fleddermann also sees the warning of 
exclusion as directed against followers of Jesus whose discipleship is 
viewed as deficient. He bases his opinion on the observation that this 
final section of Q commences with the following exhortation to 
believers: ‘enter through the narrow door, because many will seek to 
enter through it and few will find it’ (Q 13.24). Thus, according to 
Fleddermann (<a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:699), those excluded will 
‘include both the unbelieving Jews whom the gentiles displace and the 
lawless Christians who find themselves outside the closed door’.</p>
<p>Whilst Q does contain a strong negative warning of exclusion, it is 
also coupled with the stronger idea of inclusion in the kingdom. This 
participation in the reign of God is part of the spirituality of Q, 
while the present experience of the transcendent will only find full 
expression in the future eschatological banquet when Q believers enjoy 
the presence of God with the patriarchs. Here the author of Q takes the 
Jewish trope of an eschatological banquet,<a href="#FN0011_2888"><sup>11</sup></a> and universalises it to extend the possibility of salvation to all who respond to the message of Jesus. As Carroll (<a href="#CIT0003_2888">2012</a>:291)
 notes, what is promised here is emblematic of a two-dimensional 
reversal. The disciples of Jesus on the horizontal plane are linked with
 the patriarchs as the people of God, thereby displacing those who 
assumed they held this privileged position (cf. Q 3.8), and in terms of 
the vertical dimension, believers are the ones who enjoy communion with 
God in his kingdom (Carroll <a href="#CIT0003_2888">2012</a>:291). 
Therefore, the future eschatology of Q is another aspect to the form of 
spirituality offered to religionists. Whilst they are already classed 
children of God through their present life of discipleship, the future 
hope opens up the promise of an era of even greater contact with the 
deity. Using the image of the eschatological banquet, Q believers will 
be partakers in God's heavenly kingdom and will enjoy similar status to 
that of the great foundational patriarchal figures.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="13"></a><b>The humble exalted (Q 14.11)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Aligned with Q's wider perspectives on reversal generally, and more 
specifically with the form of category inversions stated in the 
beatitudes (Q 6.20–6.21), this saying presents a double inversion: 
‘everyone exalting himself will be humbled, and the one humbling himself
 will be exalted’ (Q 14.11). It needs to be acknowledged from the outset
 that not all scholars include this saying in Q, instead preferring to 
view it as a free-floating saying that has come to both Matthew and Luke
 independently via oral transmission (Vassiliades <a href="#CIT0026_2888">1978</a>:68).
 However, others see it as part of Q since there is a high degree of 
verbatim agreement between the Matthean and Lukan forms of the saying, 
and thematically it continues the emphasis in this block of Q on 
reversal in the eschatological age (Fleddermann <a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:699; Kloppenborg <a href="#CIT0013_2888">2000</a>:100). Because not all are agreed that this saying constitutes part of Q, not much weight will be placed upon it.</p>
<p>In fact, the saying reinforces perspectives on the spirituality of Q 
seen elsewhere in the document, rather than offering any innovative or 
fresh perspectives. Whilst a generalised principle is enshrined in this 
saying, in its Q setting the saying addresses a liminal group of new 
believers suffering ostracism for their choice to align themselves with a
 minority religious movement (cf. Q 6.22). The payoff that is announced 
is that in the divine economy such discipleship from those considered 
humble and of no account in earthly terms is reversed. The saying 
concludes with the future passive form of the verb: ὑψωθήσεται (Q 
14.11b). This is best understood as a divine passive. Therefore, God is 
the implied active agent, who in response to the self-abasing 
discipleship of believers reverses their status and raises them to a 
lofty or exalted position.</p>
<p>The positive benefit for believers announced in the second half of 
the saying is balanced by the negative consequence for those who are 
accused of self-exaltation. Again, a divine passive is used to portray 
their reversal of status. The vainglorious, so Q believers are informed,
 will in the future be humiliated: ταπεινωθήσεται (Q 14.11b). Once 
again, there is an eschatological dimension within the spirituality of 
Q, with true status being bestowed on people by God at a point in time 
yet to come. Thus, disciples are assured that present standing is not 
the ultimate reality. Hence the religious outlook of Q would have 
resonated with the dispossessed and lowly, since it promises redress for
 those who do not benefit materially in the contemporary circumstance. 
This is the same concept that is announced in the Q beatitudes: the poor
 possess the kingdom, the hungry will be filled, and those who mourn 
will be consoled (Q 6.20–6.21). Whilst the first of these beatitudes is 
framed as a present reality, the others have a strong eschatological 
orientation. As Tuckett (<a href="#CIT0024_2888">1996</a>:141) states, 
‘the beatitudes as a whole are all eschatological oriented’. 
Specifically he notes in relation to the beatitude on persecution that 
‘those who are at present being “persecuted” in some way are promised in
 the final beatitude (Q 6:22f.) a reward and reversal of their present 
suffering in an eschatological future’ (Tuckett <a href="#CIT0024_2888">1996</a>:141–142).
 Regardless of whether this persecution was more perceived than real, 
adherents to the teaching announced in Q viewed their own status as one 
of marginalisation in comparison to the larger society. As a response, 
the teachings contained in the Q document announced a future reversal. 
God would elevate those considered as humble and of no account, and 
consequently their true status would be revealed. Therefore, part of the
 religious hope of Q is linked to this belief of divine reversal of 
status for faithful disciples, and the spiritual aspect linked to this 
is the belief that this entails recognition by and relationship with the
 divine being.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="14"></a><b>Sitting on thrones (Q 22.28, 22.30)</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Whilst Matthew presents a form of the saying focused more 
specifically on the rewards of the Twelve with the specific promise of 
twelve thrones (Mt 19.28),<a href="#FN0012_2888"><sup>12</sup></a> Luke 
seems to present an earlier and more generalised form of the saying (Lk 
22.28). It is likely that in its Q context the saying was an aspiration 
addressed to all disciples, rather than narrowly focused upon the Twelve
 alone. The exact wording of the Q saying is difficult to reconstruct, 
especially as to whether the reference to the kingdom of God formed part
 of the original saying. Thus, three different reconstructions propose 
slightly differing wordings of this final Q saying:
</p>
<blockquote><p>You who have followed me will sit […] on throne[<i>s</i>] judging the twelve tribes of Israel. (Robinson <i>et al.</i> <a href="#CIT0019_2888">2000</a>:560)</p>
<p>You who have [<i>followed</i>] me in the [<i>kingdom</i>] &lt;…&gt; [] will sit […] on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. (Neirynck <a href="#CIT0016_2888">2001</a>:118–119)</p>
<p>You who have followed me will sit on thrones in the kingdom of God judging the twelve tribes of Israel. (Fleddermann <a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:868)</p></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of whether the Q form of the saying contained any 
reference to the kingdom, or kingdom of God, or did not mention the 
kingdom, what remains of the saying informs believers not only of a 
reversal of fortunes in the eschatological age, but promises an elevated
 status as judges over Israel.</p>
<p>Hence this final saying in Q does more than promise of reversal of 
status, it mitigates the present persecution by promising power over the
 tribes of Israel. There are several possibilities concerning why this 
judicial role in the eschaton was considered important, and how 
believers might have contemplated that they would exercise such power. 
Perhaps this saying was spoken within a context where the Q disciples 
felt that the power of the leadership in their contemporary ‘Israel’ was
 corrupt and directed against their religious allegiance to Jesus 
(Schürmann <a href="#CIT0022_2888">1957</a>:53).<a href="#FN0013_2888"><sup>13</sup></a>
 Alternatively it might have been seen as a more generalised promise 
that positions of high prominence would be given to believers in Jesus 
(Valantasis <a href="#CIT0025_2888">2005</a>:223).<a href="#FN0014_2888"><sup>14</sup></a>
 Perhaps a key element of the Q saying is that in the end-time age 
disciples will be associated with Jesus in his role as an eschatological
 judge.<a href="#FN0015_2888"><sup>15</sup></a> The promise of sitting 
on twelve thrones, at least in Q, is probably less about a new 
administration and ensuring a continuing leadership role, and more 
envisaged as an assurance of status in the new era of the kingdom (Bock <a href="#CIT0002_2888">1996</a>:1741).<a href="#FN0016_2888"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The thrones that are promised to the disciples do not need to be 
limited to a juridical role, they may also entail a regal perspective 
thereby combining royal and judicial elements in the future blessing 
enjoyed by believers. Consequently, Fitzmyer (<a href="#CIT0006_2888">1985</a>:1415)
 understands that those to whom this promise is made will be ‘not merely
 charismatic leaders, but regal figures’. In many ways, this final Q 
saying offers the most elevated promise of future reversal of status to 
contemporary believers, and within this the vision it implies is for a 
close association with both the Son of Man in his role as eschatological
 judge and with God as the kingly figure in the consummation of reign. 
Thus, disciples are told that that present partial connection with the 
deity will find full expression in the eschatological age.</p><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<p>The question of the reason why people became adherents of the Jesus 
movement in its early phase is difficult to answer, but as an early 
strand of Jesus tradition, the Q source provides some partial insights. 
The Jesus movement was a new religious movement and unsurprisingly 
disciples sought greater religious understanding and heightened 
religious experience. Those religious experiences can be understood in 
terms of the spirituality reflected in the Q document: that is the ways 
in which it promised believers in Jesus a greater degree of contact with
 the transcendent or with the deity. There seem to be three major areas 
in which Q claims that members of the early Jesus movement will gain 
deeper contact with God.</p>
<font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="16"></a><b>Filial relationship with God the Father</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Firstly, disciples will be drawn into a filial relationship with the 
deity, and God will be a father to the disciples. This relational 
language is articulated in a number of different forms in Q. Disciples 
are placed in closer contact with God through the reception of the 
Spirit, which is described by the John as a baptism (Q 3.16b). However, 
the first explicit reference in Q to followers of Jesus being children 
of God occurs in the context of the command to love one's enemies. Such 
apparently counter-intuitive action enshrines the ethics of the kingdom 
and reveals that those who are willing to absorb such violent acts 
without retaliation are actually ‘sons of your father’ (Q 6.35c). 
Whereas the devil challenged the divine sonship of Jesus in the 
temptation narrative (Q 4.1–4.13), here that title is democratised and 
transferred to all believers in the teaching contained in the sermon 
(Fleddermann <a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:330). Less overtly, filial
 language is used in the saying concerning the father making hidden 
things known to children (Q 10.21). This is a generalised saying, not 
addressed to a second person plural group.<a href="#FN0017_2888"><sup>17</sup></a>
 Nonetheless, the emphasis is clear. God, addressed as ‘Father, Lord of 
heaven and earth’, is praised for hiding his revelation from the sages 
and learned, and instead making it known to children. Here such children
 are not explicitly identified as disciples. However, given that the 
following sayings declare that knowledge of the father is disclosed 
through the son to those to whom Jesus chooses to make such revelation 
(Q 10.22), and then a beatitude is pronounced addressing a second person
 plural group stating that their eyes are blessed to see this divine 
revelation, and this is a privilege that the disciples enjoy in 
distinction from ‘prophets and kings’ (Q 10.24), there is little doubt 
that in the Q context the children mentioned in Q 10.21 are to be 
understood as disciples.</p>
<p>Similarly, Q's teaching on prayer presents disciples as having a 
special status before God. They are to address him as ‘father’ (Q 
11.2b), and they can be confident that their petitions will be answered 
since the heavenly father delights to give good things to his children 
when they ask him (Q 11.13). Therefore, Q assures disciples that the 
basis for absolute trust in God is his perfect love of them as a father 
caring for children (Manson <a href="#CIT0015_2888">1935</a>:82). This 
theme is reinforced is the Q's teaching on freedom from anxiety. 
Disciples are not to be filled with tension about provision of earthly 
needs because the one who they know as ‘father’ knows all their needs 
and will supply what is necessary for earthly life (Q 12.30).</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="17"></a><b>A life free from anxiety</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Secondly, the Q disciples are promised that their lives can be free 
from anxiety, especially through focusing on the kingdom. The 
co-ordinated sayings in Q 12.30–12.31 assure believers that their needs 
are provided by the father, and these teachings counsel the Q 
religionists to focus on kingdom matters. Again, the example of Jesus in
 the face of temptation becomes paradigmatic for disciples and they are 
to emulate his behaviour by seeking the kingdom before earthly 
sustenance. Fleddermann (<a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:615) sees this
 passage as developing a theme that is central to Q's teaching: ‘The 
initial temptation to turn stones into bread demonstrated Jesus’ turning
 away from humans’ tendency to concentrate on their physical needs’.</p>
<p>This teaching is perhaps most fully articulated in the Q beatitudes 
(Q 6.20–6.23) where the whole ethos focuses upon the certainty of 
reversal of status, and the certainty believers can have in God's care. 
There is an eschatological focus to the assurance given to disciples: 
‘rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great’ (Q 6.23a). 
However, as Betz (<a href="#CIT0001_2888">1995</a>:582) notes, ‘the 
promise of eschatological joy in the eternal kingdom of God does not 
exclude anticipated joy here on earth. On the contrary, it is the 
motivation for such earthly joy’. Hence one of the key spiritual 
promises to disciples in Q is that existence in this earthly life can be
 free of care (but not necessarily of persecution) for the kingdom is to
 be their focus (Q 12.31), and something they possess (Q 6.20b). 
Moreover, they are assured that material needs will be divinely 
provided.</p><font size="2"><font color="#5c1b1c"><a name="18"></a><b>Exaltation in the age to come</b></font></font><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #000000;margin-bottom:-8px;"></div>
<p>Thirdly, in the eschatological age, disciples will enjoy reversal of 
status, and the climax of change in status will occur with them sitting 
on thrones in a position of regal and judicial authority judging the 
tribes of Israel (Q 22.30). Whilst eschatological hope become more 
pronounced in the final section of Q (Q 13.24–22.30), it is already 
present in earlier sections of the document such as the beatitudes (Q 
6.20–6.23). One of the key spiritual blessings that believers will enjoy
 is that of taking their place at the eschatological banquet alongside 
the patriarchs (Q 13.29, 13.28). Here the rhetoric of the saying 
attempts to shame non-believing Israel with the prospect of gentiles 
participating in the future kingdom in place of those who thought they 
had the right to sit with the patriarchs. Therefore, the prospect is of 
‘repentant Gentiles – [<i>who</i>] sit down to the Messianic banquet in the Kingdom of God’ (Manson <a href="#CIT0015_2888">1935</a>:125).
 Whilst the negative aspect of the saying may be the exclusion of 
non-believing Israel, the positive hope for disciples is that those who 
receive the message of the kingdom will be included in the future that 
God has prepared for the faithful.</p>
<p>The climactic final saying of Q promises not only eschatological 
reversal, but also the reward of elevation in the presence of God. The 
promise of Jesus is that disciples will sit on thrones sharing his 
prerogatives as a royal and judicial figure in God's kingdom.</p><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<p>The modern category of ‘spirituality’ explores the sense of the 
transcendent, or the encounter with the divine that individuals or 
groups believe they experience. For Q the religious experiences that 
believers are seen as possessing by adherence to the teaching of the 
document are understood as corporate blessings often announced in the 
second person plural, and relate to closer communion with the deity. 
However, these coreligionists understand themselves as standing in 
opposition to the parent religion of 1st century institutional Judaism. 
Not only is the message of Jesus rejected by the majority of pious Jews 
with whom Q believers interacted (Foster <a href="#CIT0010_2888">2013</a>:367–394),<a href="#FN0018_2888"><sup>18</sup></a>
 but in addition to non-acceptance of this message the Q believers 
considered themselves to be persecuted or ostracised by the parent 
religion (Q 6.22–6.23).</p>
<p>Given the rejection of the message of Jesus as presented in Q and the
 alienation of the minority who accepted the teaching of Q, one may ask 
what the perceived benefits were that motivated Q disciples to maintain 
their commitment to the new religious movement. It is suggested here 
that the ideas of spirituality and religious experience help explain 
that ongoing commitment. First adherents believed they enjoyed a 
privileged relationship with God, who they could address as father, and 
that this was not supplied by the larger parent religious movement to 
which they stood in opposition. Secondly, even in the face of 
persecution, disciples hold to the assurance that they have in fact been
 freed from earthly anxieties and are thereby able to focus on spiritual
 matters, that is the kingdom (Q 12.31). Lastly, Q believers had a 
strong sense of an eschatological future in which their status would not
 only be reversed, but because of their fidelity they would be elevated 
to prominent roles in God’ kingdom. In that future realm they would 
recline at table with figures of exemplary faith and piety (Q 13.29, 
13.28) and they would be installed as those who exercise regal judgement
 over those seen as their oppressors (Q 22.28, 22.30) (Jacobson <a href="#CIT0012_2888">1992</a>:244–248).
 It was this mix of future hope and present spiritual experiences that 
enabled the Q disciples to maintain their commitment to the marginal 
religious movement.</p>

the text of Q. For the purpose of this article, several reconstructions 
will be consulted. Priority will be given to Robinson, Hoffmann and 
Kloppenborg (<a href="#CIT0019_2888">2000</a>). Alongside this edition, this study will consult the reconstructed text in Fleddermann (<a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>) and Neirynck (<a href="#CIT0016_2888">2001</a>).</p>
<p><a id="FN0005_2888"></a>5. For a discussion of the role of the coming one in Q, see Foster (<a href="#CIT0008_2888">2008</a>:81–91).</p>
<p><a id="FN0006_2888"></a>6. Nolland (<a href="#CIT0017_2888">1989</a>:300) comes to a similar comment in relation to the function of this material in its Lukan setting; he states that ‘[<i>t</i>]o
 be a son of God here is not the verdict of the future judgment. It is 
rather the present manifestation in the believer through love of enemy 
of a nobility like that of love of God who is kind even to the 
ungrateful’.</p>
<p><a id="FN0007_2888"></a>7. As Nolland (<a href="#CIT0018_2888">1993</a>:575) expresses the relationship as follows: ‘[<i>t</i>]he
 mutual knowledge is not the goal of the present saying, but only forms 
the basis for the final clause of the verse where the real intention 
becomes clear. If initially others are left outside the intimacy of this
 mutual knowing, it is only to be finally, at the Son's initiative and 
discretion, invited to share in a knowledge of God as Faher, through 
Jesus’ proclamation and preliminary enactment of the kingdom of God’.</p>
<p><a id="FN0008_2888"></a>8. As Fleddermann (<a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:473,
 n. 252) observes, ’father’ and ‘son’ language is prominent in the 
second major section of Q material (Q 9.57–11.13), with son language in 
all four pericopae of the section and the term father occurring in 
three.</p>
<p><a id="FN0009_2888"></a>9. The Matthean parallel is found in Matthew 8.11–8.12. Luz (<a href="#CIT0014_2888">2001</a>:9)
 states, ‘Matthew probably has taken over this logion from Q somewhat 
literally. In my judgment the Matthean form, with its neat parallelism 
that contrasts with Luke 13:28–29 where the logion has been adapted to 
its context, is primary’.</p>
<p><a id="FN0010_2888"></a>10. Cf. Robinson <i>et al.</i> (<a href="#CIT0019_2888">2000</a>:416).</p>
<p><a id="FN0011_2888"></a>11. See Isaiah 25.6–25.8, 55.1–55.2, 65.13–65.14; Zephaniah 1.7; 1QSa 2.15–2.22.</p>
<p><a id="FN0012_2888"></a>12. This also reflects Matthew's wider 
tendency to identify reference in his sources to disciples specifically 
with the Twelve. See Fleddermann (<a href="#CIT0007_2888">2005</a>:868–869).</p>
<p><a id="FN0013_2888"></a>13. Schürmann (<a href="#CIT0022_2888">1957</a>:53) sees the saying as responding to the situation of the persecuted disciples.</p>
<p><a id="FN0014_2888"></a>14. Valantasis (<a href="#CIT0025_2888">2005</a>:223) comments that ‘[<i>f</i>]rom
 the perspectives of the Jesus movements, however, the ascendancy 
belonged to them. Their following Jesus entitled them to a throne and to
 passing sentence upon others’.</p>
<p><a id="FN0015_2888"></a>15. Q 3.16–3.17, 12.8–12.9, 39–40, 42b–46, 13.24–13.27, 17.34–17.35.</p>
<p><a id="FN0016_2888"></a>16. In relation to the Lukan formulation of this material, Bock (<a href="#CIT0002_2888">1996</a>:1741)
 suggests that the disciples ‘will have a continuing role under “new 
management,” in an administration to be revealed in the future but 
having validity now’.</p>
<p><a id="FN0017_2888"></a>17. It is possible that this saying 
originally circulated independently of its Q context, and functioned as a
 general statement of warning against the wise, and in a broad way spoke
 of the uneducated as the recipients of Jesus’ teaching. However, in its
 current context in Q it functions to affirm disciples as the privileged
 recipients of revelation and to declare their status as God's children.</p>
<p><a id="FN0018_2888"></a>18. On the social location of the Q believers, see Foster (<a href="#CIT0009_2888">2012</a>:179–201) and Foster (<a href="#CIT0010_2888">2013</a>:367–394).</p>
