	<meta name="description" content="This article offers a textual “deep map” of a series of experimental commutes undertaken in the west of Scotland in 2014. Recent developments in the field of transport studies have reconceived travel time as a far richer cultural experience than in previously utilitarian and economic approaches to the “problem” of commuting. Understanding their own commutes in these terms—as spaces of creativity, productivity and transformation—the authors trace the development of a performative “counterpractice” for their daily journeys between home and work. Deep mapping—as a form of “theory-informed story-telling”—is employed as a productive strategy to document this reimagination of ostensibly quotidian and functional travel. Importantly, this particular stage of the project is not presented as an end-point. Striving to develop an ongoing creative engagement with landscape, the authors continue this exploratory mobile research by connecting to other commuters’ journeys, and proposing a series of “strategies” for reimagining the daily commute; a list of prompts for future action within the routines and spaces of commuting. A range of alternative approaches to commuting are offered here to anyone who regularly travels to and from work to employ or develop as they wish, extending the mapping process to other routes and contexts.">

      This article offers a textual “deep map” of a series of 
experimental commutes undertaken in the west of Scotland in 2014. Recent
 developments in the field of transport studies have reconceived travel 
time as a far richer cultural experience than in previously utilitarian 
and economic approaches to the “problem” of commuting. Understanding 
their own commutes in these terms—as spaces of creativity, productivity 
and transformation—the authors trace the development of a performative 
“counterpractice” for their daily journeys between home and work. Deep 
mapping—as a form of “theory-informed story-telling”—is employed as a 
productive strategy to document this reimagination of ostensibly 
quotidian and functional travel. Importantly, this particular stage of 
the project is not presented as an end-point. Striving to develop an 
ongoing creative engagement with landscape, the authors continue this 
exploratory mobile research by connecting to other commuters’ journeys, 
and proposing a series of “strategies” for reimagining the daily 
commute; a list of prompts for future action within the routines and 
spaces of commuting. A range of alternative approaches to commuting are 
offered here to anyone who regularly travels to and from work to employ 
or develop as they wish, extending the mapping process to other routes 
and contexts.

    <section id="sec1-humanities-04-00476" type="intro"><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  1. Introduction</h2><p>In
 2011, we set up Making Routes; a network and online resource for 
researchers and practitioners working with mobilities in contemporary 
performance [<a title="" href="#B2-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">2</a>]. We organised a symposium at the Arches arts centre in Glasgow [<a title="" href="#B3-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">3</a>], and ran a series of events including Phil Smith’s <span class="html-italic">Misguided in Ayr</span> [<a title="" href="#B4-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">4</a>].
 Our interest in journeys continued independently, with the occasional 
opportunity to exchange ideas and discuss our various projects. We think
 that the idea of working together was always there, but it was not 
until September 2013 that we decided to collaborate on a research 
project. At the beginning, neither of us was clear on what that might 
be. We thought we might travel somewhere together, or make a performance
 about journeys. We started without a destination in mind, which is 
probably the best way to start.</p><p>Lacking a clear direction, we 
found it difficult to make time to work together, and with both of our 
lives including full-time lecturing posts and long commutes, we were 
initially anxious about when we would be able to embark on the journeys 
we wanted to take: Laura travels by car, ferry and train every day from 
Innellan on the West Coast of Scotland to the Royal Conservatoire of 
Scotland (RCS) in Glasgow; David drives from Glasgow to the University 
of the West of Scotland’s (UWS) Ayr campus. It was for a practical 
reason, then, that the first stage of this project was for us to 
accompany each other on our commutes, and it was during these specific 
and purposeful journeys, and the subsequent meal at each other’s homes, 
that we started to think critically about our daily, repetitive 
mobility. Laura kept a research diary of these initial conversations:
	  </p><blockquote><p>Tuesday 24th September 2013</p><p>17:25 train, 18:20 boat, arrive home at 19:00</p><p>The
 train is busy. David and I travel back to my house together to talk 
about our project. David tells me that his commute is very different as 
his is solo in a car while mine is mainly made up of public transport 
surrounded by other bodies and has four different stages. We talk about 
lots of things that are going on in our lives (work, relationships, 
performances we have seen) but we don’t talk much about the project 
until we are at my house and having some dinner that I have prepared the
 night before. We come up with some areas to research and both agree 
that doing each other’s commutes is an important part of this process. 
We arrange for me to do David’s commute on the 7th October and through 
this conversation I see my journey through David’s eyes. I drive him to 
the ferry at 20:45 and David travels back to Glasgow alone [<a title="" href="#B5-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">5</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Our
 discussions around this project encouraged us to consider documenting 
our commutes as times and spaces of possibility and creative 
resistance—a way of reimagining aspects of the working day. This article
 focuses on the first stage of this process—an attempt to develop a 
“deep map” of our experiences-so-far.</p><p>Commuting has often been 
dismissed as a “desensitising” experience in which Sennett identifies a 
“disconnection from space as the body moves passively” through urban 
roadscapes ([<a title="" href="#B6-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">6</a>], p. 18). Likewise, Jean Baudrillard refers to the “effortless mobility” of car journeys ([<a title="" href="#B7-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">7</a>], p. 66); and Michel de Certeau points out the “immobility” engendered by train travel ([<a title="" href="#B8-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">8</a>],
 p. 111). In the field of transport studies and policy, the perception 
of commuting as a “problem” has led to an assumption that travel time is
 inherently unproductive ([<a title="" href="#B9-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">9</a>],
 p. 81). As Patricia Mokhtarian points out, as a result “virtually all 
of our policies, planning, and models are predicated on the assumption 
that travel is a disutility to be minimised” ([<a title="" href="#B10-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">10</a>],
 p. 93). However, others have recognised greater complexity in the 
experience of contemporary mobilities, which involves an uneasy 
combination of “experimentation and danger, possibility and risk” ([<a title="" href="#B11-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">11</a>],
 p. x). Identifying this complexity in our everyday journeys, we are 
interested in capturing our commutes as far more active and embodied 
experiences than the unsatisfactory interpretations of many critical 
representations, and transport policies. Like Tim Edensor, we distrust 
the popular perception that the commuter is “a frustrated, passive and 
bored figure, patiently suffering the anomic tedium of the monotonous or
 disrupted journey” ([<a title="" href="#B12-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">12</a>],
 p. 189). Instead, we are interested in the potential of travel time as a
 “gift” that is “a desirable time for many people” who value the 
opportunity to transition between modes of living and working, and to 
take “time out” as a retreat from external demands ([<a title="" href="#B9-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">9</a>], p. 88).</p><p>In
 the sections that follow, we present a “deep map” of our explorations 
into our daily commutes as fertile ground for creativity, productivity 
and transformation. We present a series of autoethnographic narratives, 
documenting our alternative commutes, which we undertook initially by 
walking, and then by cycling, swimming and boating the route between our
 homes and our places of work. Together, this interconnected web of 
personal account, anecdote, critical reflection and reminiscence, offers
 a textual map of these regular routes. Mike Pearson and Michael Shanks 
identify the potential of such a map—a form of “theory-informed 
story-telling” ([<a title="" href="#B13-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">13</a>],
 p. 16)—to contain juxtapositions and interpenetrations of the 
historical and the contemporary, the political and the poetic, the 
factual and the fictional, the discursive and the sensual; the 
conflation of oral testimony, anthology, memoir, biography, natural 
history and everything you might ever want to say about a place ([<a title="" href="#B14-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">14</a>], pp. 64–65).</p><p>This approach “attempts to record and represent the grain and patina of a <span class="html-italic">location</span>” (our italics) ([<a title="" href="#B13-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">13</a>], p. 15). However, for this project, we are interested in deep mapping a <span class="html-italic">route</span>.
 This process attempts not only to map—to record, document, 
represent—but also to engage with our commutes actively through a 
performative engagement with landscape; mobilising a variety of 
experiences that work against the “desensitising” systems of 
contemporary mobile life. Our approach draws on the “mobility turn” in 
the field of performance studies, and recent research into “a wealth of 
performances and related cultural practices [that] have been, and 
continue to be, actively engaged in imagining, exploring, revealing and 
challenging experiences of being in transit” [<a title="" href="#B15-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">15</a>]; ([<a title="" href="#B16-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">16</a>],
 p. 1). Fiona Wilkie recognises the affective quality of performance in 
this context, as “performance not only responds to but can also produce 
mobilities, reshaping existing models and engendering new, alternative 
possibilities for movement” ([<a title="" href="#B16-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">16</a>], p. 2).</p><p>Importantly,
 we do not see this particular iteration of our project as an end-point.
 As such, we have aimed to leave our discursive map open ended, 
developing a series of experiments and “strategies” for reimagining the 
daily commute and extending our mapping project beyond our own journeys.
 These take the form of a postcard project on the Gourock to Dunoon 
ferry route (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f001" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 1</a>)
 and a list of instructions, which we offer here to anyone who regularly
 travels to and from work to employ or develop as they wish. Similar to 
Carl Lavery’s <span class="html-italic">25 Instructions for Performance in Cities</span> [<a title="" href="#B17-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">17</a>], or Phil Smith’s Mythogeographical “Toolbag of Actions and Notions” ([<a title="" href="#B18-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">18</a>], pp. 144–75), these strategies are “there to be given life by their readers”, not as endpoints of our own explorations ([<a title="" href="#B18-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">18</a>],
 p. 9). Ultimately, they are offered as prompts to performative action 
within the routines and spaces of commuting. In recording and 
representing such activities, a performative document will emerge that 
extends our mapping process beyond the scope of this article to engage 
with other forms and methods of mapping everyday journeys. Alongside the
 deep map presented here, we continue to gather stories and images of 
experimental commuting journeys on our website: <a href="http://www.makingroutes.org/" target="_blank">www.makingroutes.org</a> [<a title="" href="#B2-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">2</a>].</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f001">

 mapping process is influenced by concepts of mobility drawn from 
nomadic theory: the condition of nomadism; and an attempt to incorporate
 a nomadic form of mobility into our regular journeys. Drawing on the 
“nomadology” of Deleuze and Guattari [<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>], and Rosi Braidotti [<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>],
 we aim to document a performative “counterpractice”, learning more 
about our own commuting routes by considering alternative ways of 
traveling between two sites, and examining our exiting daily journeys 
through the lens of these key theorists of contemporary mobilities. 
Before discussing our own experiences, it will therefore be valuable to 
consider the potential for, and limitations of, a nomadic form of 
commuting.</p><p>As we have discussed, commuting is often portrayed as a
 problematically limited, constrained and regulated mobile practice. In 
contrast, Pearson sees the nomad as an aspirational figure, “cut free of
 roots, bonds and fixed identities” ([<a title="" href="#B21-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">21</a>],
 p. 20). Nomadism offers a valuable counterpoint to commuting, then, but
 it is a concept that we are anxious about adopting too readily without 
confronting some of the potential problems with its use. As Tim Creswell
 points out, although the metaphor lends itself to an antiessentialist 
discourse that emphasises “the importance of <span class="html-italic">becoming</span>”
 over that of destinations, the use of the nomad in Western intellectual
 thought is essentially “a form of imaginative neo-colonialism” which 
uses the non-Western other to project romanticised notions of mobility 
against the sedentary power relations of the State ([<a title="" href="#B22-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">22</a>], p. 47, 54). Embracing the concept of the nomad runs the risk of ignoring “who travels and why” ([<a title="" href="#B23-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">23</a>], p. 361).</p><p>These
 questions are particularly pertinent to a discussion of commuting, as a
 mobile practice that is constituted through significant social and 
economic hierarchies. Gil Viry <span class="html-italic">et al</span>. 
identify a range of factors that lead to inequality in contemporary 
commuting practices that is predicated on access to certain forms of 
mobility. These include not owning a car, residential areas with poor 
access to public transport, and “weak temporal or organisational 
resources to handle projects that require travel” ([<a title="" href="#B24-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">24</a>],
 p. 121). These factors contribute to an important shift in the way we 
acquire and build capital in a mobile world, which John Urry refers to 
as “network capital” ([<a title="" href="#B25-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">25</a>],
 p. 197). The ability to move (or to choose not to move) now constitutes
 a “major source of advantage” in a society that relies, more than ever 
before, on systems and processes of mobility ([<a title="" href="#B25-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">25</a>], p. 52).</p><p>Deleuze
 and Guattari’s discussion of nomadic forms of mobility provides a 
valuable aspirational counterpoint to this heavily systematised, 
regulated and unequal spaces traversed through commuting. Unlike the 
“striated” space of roads, ferry routes and trainlines that we use to 
transport ourselves between work and home, nomad space is <span class="html-italic">smooth</span>, defined by “the variability, the polyvocality of directions” ([<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>],
 p. 382). Moving within vast, open spaces such as deserts, tundras and 
steppes, nomads make paths, moving from point to point through the 
landscape. However, as opposed to sedentary societies, the points of a 
nomad journey are “strictly subordinated to the paths they determine”, 
rather than the other way round ([<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>],
 p. 380). Importantly, although commuting does not fit easily within 
this model, this is not to say that the commute precludes a nomadic 
relationship with the environment:
	  </p><blockquote><p>Even the most striated city gives rise to smooth 
spaces […] Movements, speed and slowness, are sometimes enough to 
reconstruct a smooth space. Of course, smooth spaces are not in 
themselves liberatory. But the struggle is changed or displaced in them,
 and life reconstitutes its stakes, confronts new obstacles, invents new
 places, switches adversaries.</p><p class="html-blockquote-attrib">([<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>], p. 500)</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Bearing
 in mind Deleuze and Guattari’s warning that we should “never believe 
that a smooth space will suffice to save us”, we recognise that our 
creative explorations of our own commutes are significantly limited in 
their ability to address the network capital that we require to go “off 
route”. We are nonetheless setting out on a personal journey to 
“confront new obstacles” and “reconstitute the stakes” of regular 
journeys which have occasionally left us feeling “desensitised” to our 
own bodily experience of the landscapes that we move through. In this 
way, the example of the nomad offers us a new way of thinking about and 
experiencing our commutes, rather than reconstituting the systems that 
contain them and the socio-economic context that we travel within. 
Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of <span class="html-italic">reconstitution</span>
 resonates with Braidotti’s concept of nomadism as “a myth, or a 
political fiction, that allows us to think through and move across 
established categories and levels of experience” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>],
 p. 26). Braidotti advocates “nomadic shifts”; “a performative metaphor 
that allows for otherwise unlikely encounters and unsuspected sources of
 interaction, experience and knowledge” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>], p. 27). In these shifts, our everyday practices are opened up to the creative processes of <span class="html-italic">becoming</span>, offering an “acute awareness of the nonfixity of boundaries” and “the intense desire to go trespassing, transgressing” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>], p. 66).</p><p>Critical
 appropriations of nomadism have acquired a great deal of currency in 
postmodern accounts of mobility and it is easy to see how they suit our 
purpose here. These concepts offer an appealing invitation to the 
disgruntled daily commuter to leave the striated space of the commute 
and go “trespassing” and “transgressing”. The details of the specific 
journey must be taken into account, although the tools we offer can be 
applied to any commute in an attempt to enact “nomadic shifts”. What 
mode of transport is employed? Is it public or private? What is the 
usual pace of this journey? Is the journey open to disruption? Wilkie 
identifies that discourses of walking practices such as pace, value, 
autonomy and agency can also be applied to road travel but questions 
whether “motorvating” actually does open up “previously unavailable 
opportunities for freedom, escape and subversion” ([<a title="" href="#B16-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">16</a>], p. 85) or whether the “democratisation” of road travel has remained mythic for those without network capital.</p><p>As
 pointed out by Janet Wolff, the “suggestion of free and equal mobility 
is itself a deception, since we don’t all have the same access to the 
road” ([<a title="" href="#B26-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">26</a>], p. 235). As a result, Cresswell has been challenging the “romanticisation of the nomad as the geographic metaphor <span class="html-italic">par excellence</span>: for some time ([<a title="" href="#B22-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">22</a>], pp. 42–54); ([<a title="" href="#B23-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">23</a>],
 p. 361). Embracing the metaphor of “generalised heroic figures 
resisting the confines of a disciplinary society” (itself a specifically
 postmodern appropriation of a previously vilified cultural figure), is 
to “gloss over the real differences in power that exist between the 
theorist and the source domain of the metaphors of mobility” ([<a title="" href="#B23-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">23</a>],
 pp. 378–79). It is important to point out, therefore, that we are not 
claiming that our creative experiments in the spaces of our daily 
commutes could be described as <span class="html-italic">nomadic</span>,
 or indeed that such a thing as nomadic commuting could ever exist, let 
alone be captured on a map. Rather, we are using “nomadology”, and the <span class="html-italic">creative becoming</span>
 the myth of the nomad encapsulates, to prompt an alternative way of 
thinking about quotidian and functional journeys that prioritises 
creativity and imagination over an assumption of disutility within 
striated space. We aim to “mobilise metaphors of mobility” by exploring 
different ways of engaging with the landscapes that we move through 
between home and work ([<a title="" href="#B22-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">22</a>],
 p. 56). By temporarily departing from our usual modes of transport, we 
intend to re-perform our own repetitive forms of mobility and reconnect 
to our regular routes through a series of experimentations with 
different modes, rhythms and conditions of travel.</p></section><section id="sec3-humanities-04-00476" type=""><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  3. Mapping Our Commutes</h2><p>Laura’s
 commute is made up of four parts. The “rhythms” of her journey between 
Sandy Beach, where she lives, and her place of work in Glasgow, 
incorporate a ten minute drive from her house to the ferry terminal in 
Dunoon, a 25 minute ferry across the Clyde estuary, a 44 minute train 
journey from Gourock to Glasgow and a ten minute walk up Hope Street 
from Central Station to the RCS.</p><p>David’s 50 minute car journey 
from Glasgow to Ayr takes him initially through a maze of residential 
streets, roundabouts and traffic lights to the ramp at the end of the 
Great Western Road where he joins a short stretch of the M8 south 
through the city and over the River Clyde to join the M77, which cuts 
through the Ayrshire countryside before meeting the A77 at Kilmarnock. 
This is “Route 77”, according to the sign for Balbir’s Restaurant which 
marks the final stage of his journey, and he has always enjoyed the 
connection to the great American highway.</p><p>We started this project 
by keeping commuting diaries, documenting the range of activities 
undertaken during our regular journeys to and from work. Laura kept a 
notebook record of her journeys every day between September and December
 2013:
	  </p><blockquote><p>Tuesday 15th October 2013</p><p>7:00 leave house, 7:15 boat, 7:47 train, 8:45 arrive at work.</p><p>17:25 train, 18:20 boat, 19:00 arrive home.</p><p>On
 both journeys today I read Rebecca Solnit’s A Field Guide to Getting 
Lost. I like it and a statement in capital letters on the back cover 
reads ‘NEVER TO GET LOST IS NOT TO LIVE’ [<a title="" href="#B27-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">27</a>].</p><p>Monday 28th October 2013</p><p>16:55 train, 17:50 boat, 18:30 arrive home.</p><p>I
 take my suitcase on the train and finish reading the book my Aunt Mo 
has lent me called Olive Kitteridge. It is falling to bits as she read 
it on her travels to India. It travelled with me to Manchester but was 
not read [<a title="" href="#B5-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">5</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Reflecting
 on her diary, Laura observed behaviours that she performs repeatedly; 
mainly reading and sleeping! She enjoyed noticing how many books had 
been passed on to her from friends and family, and how the books were on
 their own journeys through “striated space” of commuter routes, being 
marked by their journeys and the bodies that facilitated their 
wanderings.</p><p>Meanwhile, limited by his role of driver, David used 
the hands-free mobile phone device in his car to phone spoken diary 
entries to himself, which he later transferred to MP3 files and 
transcribed.
	  </p><blockquote><p>It’s drizzly but the sun is cutting through the 
clouds and picking out the oranges and browns of the autumn trees. And 
it makes me think this is so much better than having to commute on an 
underground train in a busy city. I really value this time to drive 
through the countryside every day [<a title="" href="#B28-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">28</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>This
 process of keeping commuting diaries prompted us to look for ways to 
open up our journeys and to more meaningfully connect with our commutes 
and the spaces that we move through. Entries immediately reveal an 
active and productive use of travel time. However, this is too often a 
movement that drives “through” landscape, rather than travelling “into” 
it; and while our modes of transport carry their own particular risks, 
they generally operate through a comfortable dislocation from our wider 
environment. Less expensive, and ecologically damaging forms of 
transport—such as walking and cycling—allow a different type of 
engagement with commuting routes. While the choice to walk and cycle is 
significantly determined by levels of network capital, it is also the 
case that walking and cycling have the potential to be more exciting, 
pleasurable, interesting and relaxing than other modes of transport, and
 that the physical dimension of these more basic modes has a range of 
benefits to the regular commuter [<a title="" href="#B29-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">29</a>].
 This raised an important question for our project: how could we 
temporarily shift our commuting practices to other forms of travel that 
might offer us a more corporeal, visceral and hands-on encounter with 
our routes? And what “benefits” might we accrue through this process?</p><p>There are significant parts of our journeys that more closely resemble Sennett’s version of desensitised travel [<a title="" href="#B6-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">6</a>]:
	  </p><blockquote><p>Monday 4th November 2013</p><p>6:30 leave house, 6:45 boat, 8:45 arrive at work.</p><p>There
 is a boat refit on from the 4th to the 16th of November so I have to 
leave my house at 6:30 to get in for 9am. There is a long gap between 
the boat and the train and the train at this time of the morning is very
 cold. I read Uncle Silas (on loan from my sister) and doze on the 
train.</p><p>Sunday 24th November 2013</p><p>18:00 Western ferry, arrive home 19:00.</p><p>I drive so cannot do anything with the time [<a title="" href="#B5-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">5</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>There
 are also moments when we are prevented from undertaking the necessary 
journeys. In general, Laura’s journey is much more prone to disruption 
than David’s due to the modes of transport involved:
	  </p><blockquote><p>Thursday 5th December 2013</p><p>Both boats are 
off due to high winds and the road is flooded so I cannot travel to work
 today. This is the first time this has happened this year and I miss 
the second year show that I am supposed to be assessing which I am 
really disappointed about [<a title="" href="#B5-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">5</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The commute is often perceived, and experienced, as a boring, stressful and frustrating form of mobility [<a title="" href="#B30-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">30</a>] (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f002" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 2</a>).
 However, for Edensor this “everyday realm” of “habit, routine, 
unreflexive forms of common sense, and rituals […] paradoxically also 
contains the seeds of resistance and escape from uniformity [through] 
the intrusions of dreams, involuntary memories, peculiar events, and 
uncanny sentiments” ([<a title="" href="#B31-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">31</a>], pp. 154–55). The etymology of the word “commute” is from the Latin “<span class="html-italic">commutare</span>”, which means “to change, transform, exchange” [<a title="" href="#B32-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">32</a>].
 We are interested in the potential of this repetitive journey from home
 to work as creative or transformative. Braidotti claims: “the 
imagination is not utopian, but rather transformative and inspirational”
 and we wanted to use this collaborative project as an opportunity to 
experience these journeys anew, to revise them and re-imagine them” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>], p. 14). We have found that the experience of being in transit lends itself to such moments of imaginative departure.</p><p>Laura
 Watts and Glenn Lyons account for the imaginative dimension of travel, 
arguing that movement leads to an “ambiguity of place”, a “liminality” 
that can foster “a valued sense of creativity, possibility and 
transition” ([<a title="" href="#B33-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">33</a>],
 p. 109). We set out to disrupt the regular patterns of our commutes and
 have used the “gift of travel time” to mobilise a critical engagement 
with our commuting behaviours [<a title="" href="#B9-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">9</a>].
 This has led us to seek alternative commuting methods, which use 
different rhythms, physicalities, routes and durations, and opens up our
 journeys to riskier, messier forms of mobility. Where we usually travel
 by car, ferry or train, we therefore set out to discover what walking, 
cycling, swimming and boating might teach us about our journeys to work.</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f002">

</div><p>Four key concepts define the theoretical landscape through 
which we travelled. However, as our experiences have shown, there are no
 clear boundaries here. We are moving through heterogeneous and multiple
 spaces, and routes interweave, blur into each other and amalgamate. 
These concepts offer us a structure, then, but should not be understood 
as discrete, fixed categories: first, convergences and divergences of 
paths and routes and their relationship to the boundaries and barriers 
that contain and define them; second, notions of becoming, changing and 
transferring; third, patterns and rhythms of commuting and ways of 
documenting and analysing these processes; and fourth, the corporeality 
of commuting as an embodied practice. Together, these concepts offered 
us an analytical framework for our exploratory journeys, and a set of 
“guidelines” for the process of recording and representing these 
journeys, and we paid careful attention to these aspects of our 
alternative commutes. They provide a loose structure for the map that is
 beginning to emerge. In the remainder of this article, we present a 
textual and photographic “deep map” of our walked journeys, followed by 
individual representations of swimming (Laura), cycling (David), and 
boating (Laura). This is followed by a brief discussion of the postcard 
project conducted by Laura on the Gourock to Dunoon ferry route, in 
order to open up our personal experiments to consider, and learn from, 
other people’s experiences of commuting (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f003" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 3</a>).
 We conclude the article with our suggested “strategies for performing 
the daily commute” in the hope that others will take up our invitation 
and map their reimagined regular journeys.</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f003">

</div></section><section id="sec4-humanities-04-00476" type=""><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  4. Walking (Laura Bissell (LB) and David Overend (DO)</h2><p>For
 Braidotti, “nomadic subjectivity” is an opportunity “to identify lines 
of flight, that is to say, a creative alternative space of becoming that
 would fall not between the mobile/immobile, but within both of these 
categories” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>],
 p. 7). This linking of “lines of flight” with “a creative, alternative 
space of becoming” offered us a valuable starting point and in March 
2014, we both set out to walk our commutes. David walked 48 miles in 
three days from his home in Glasgow to the University of the West of 
Scotland in Ayr. A few days later, after a ferry journey from her home 
on the Cowal Peninsula, Laura walked 27 miles to the Royal Conservatoire
 of Scotland in Glasgow over the course of one day. Ostensibly, our 
commutes close down lines of flight to fixed paths across “striated” 
landscapes [<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>].
 These walks aspired to the opposite—open routes through smooth spaces. 
What follows is an account of the beginning of our research journeys 
made up partially from our written responses and critical reflections on
 our reimagined commutes.</p><p>Shortly after leaving his flat, David 
followed a path along the River Kelvin. In his written account of the 
walk, he reflects on the way in which our routes through cities often 
follow fixed paths:
	  </p><blockquote><p>I [...] realise how much of the city is cut up and
 divided by fixed routes and paths. This grid of different boundaries 
and trajectories comprises bridges, footpaths, cycle lanes, roads, 
railways, canals and flight paths [...] But as I walk from point to 
point, following some routes and crossing others, I do not feel hemmed 
in or constrained. There is a freedom in this journey and an 
exhilarating sense of moving beyond the prescribed uses of urban space [<a title="" href="#B34-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">34</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>For
 both of us, undertaking our journeys independently, we enjoyed this 
sensation of transgression or resistance. As Deirdre Heddon points out, 
walking allows a potentially “resistant” engagement with 
landscape—resistance “to habit, to capitalism, to rules, to 
expectations” (and, suggests Smith, “to fashion”) ([<a title="" href="#B18-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">18</a>], p. 198); [<a title="" href="#B35-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">35</a>], p. 104). Our diaries reveal numerous occasions when we moved against the habits, rules and expectations of our commutes (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f004" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 4</a>).
 We also observed the “resistant” behaviour of other commuters. For 
example, Laura recounts a moment when a fellow pedestrian breaks out of a
 designated route:
	  </p><blockquote><p>as I am about to walk around the cordoned section 
to allow me to move towards Gourock, the woman in front of me undoes the
 catch on one of the metal gates, opens it and walks through [...] I 
follow her lead, glad of this minor transgression of the authoritative 
paths and designated walkways that the area by the water assigns [<a title="" href="#B36-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">36</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f004">

</div><p>We are wary about the claims that can be made for such 
activities and want to avoid what Doreen Massey dismisses as “the least 
politically convincing of situationist capers” ([<a title="" href="#B37-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">37</a>],
 p. 46). However, these moments of quotidian transgression offered many 
important formative experiences during our walks, many of which involved
 a rupture or break in an established pattern or rhythm that we have 
previously felt frustratingly locked into. Employing Braidotti’s “myth” 
of the nomadic subject to “[blur] boundaries without burning bridges” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>],
 p. 26), these moments of transgression during our walks allowed us to 
reimagine our commutes as something other than functional and transitory
 journeys through the spaces between home and work.</p><p>Braidotti’s 
focus on process and “becoming nomad” is analogous to looking for a 
marker on a road or path: “the nomadic subject is not a utopian concept,
 but more like a road sign” ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>],
 p. 14). For much of Laura’s early route, particularly in the Argyll and
 Inverclyde stages, the road signs are supplemented by another with the 
Gaelic version of the town name. Often there are four signs which read 
as a list: district, town, PLEASE DRIVE CAREFULLY, and the Gaelic 
version (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f005" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 5</a>).
 Laura notices that a large number of the signs also have stickers on 
them, added by people. Signs are objects that invite us to look at them 
for information or guidance, but these have been augmented by the 
public, creating an alternative meaning to that which was intended. What
 the signs are signifying is also in a state of becoming; the meaning 
malleable and open to interpretation, obliteration, and subversion.</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f005">

</div><p>These signs served as regular route-markers and they 
established a rhythm to these walks—marking progress by miles walked and
 hours passed. However, because “all spaces are dynamic and continually 
pulse with a multitude of co-existing rhythms and flows”, some rhythms 
became more apparent than others ([<a title="" href="#B12-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">12</a>], p. 200). During his walk, David reflected on the rhythms of his regular journey by car:
	  </p><blockquote><p>In my car, the rhythm of the road takes precedence as my ‘insulated mobile body’ remains oblivious to everything else ([<a title="" href="#B12-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">12</a>],
 p. 200), but this walk allows me to seek out, sense and immerse myself 
in multiple rhythms including weather, seasons, animals and people who 
use and inhabit the landscape that the road cuts through. As I approach 
Symington, there is a brief moment when I can see the A77, the Firth of 
Clyde and a Ryanair plane taking off from Prestwick—rhythms and flows 
coexisting [<a title="" href="#B34-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">34</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Earlier
 in his walk, crossing Eaglesham Moor, the rhythms of Whitelee Windfarm 
create a unique relationship between technology and landscape (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f006" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 6</a>):
	  </p><blockquote><p>We surrender to the hypnotic quality of the 
turbines, which offer a regularity and rhythm approximating the effect 
of music. Our ambulatory rhythms sync up with the rotations of the 
blades and we adjust our pace accordingly. One foot after the other 
meets one rotation after the other. At the same time, in this exposed 
location, rain beats into our bodies and blasts our faces with icy 
water. The wind is blowing in tremendous gusts, which drown out all 
other noises, but in the occasional dip, our ears tune into another 
constant sound—the faint, humming drone of the windfarm [<a title="" href="#B34-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">34</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f006">

</div><p>Edensor points out that commuting takes place within 
“routinised, synchronic rhythms [which] are bureaucratically regulated 
and collectively produced” ([<a title="" href="#B12-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">12</a>],
 p. 196). In the systematised rhythms of motorways and shipping lanes, 
these natural rhythms—of weather seasons, animals and people—can easily 
be obscured. For Henri Lefebvre [<a title="" href="#B38-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">38</a>],
 the establishment and regulation of rhythms is one of the key ways by 
which late capitalism produces and controls space. Similarly, Deleuze 
and Guattari identify “the function of the sedentary road, which is to <span class="html-italic">parcel out a closed space to people</span>, assigning each person a share and regulating the communication between shares” ([<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>],
 p. 380). By attempting to establish a “nomadic trajectory” we aspire 
towards the opposite: movement within what Deleuze and Guattari refer to
 as “<span class="html-italic">an open space</span>” ([<a title="" href="#B19-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">19</a>],
 p. 380) and the potential to take up Edensor’s project of “tailor[ing 
our] journeys in accordance with [our] own strategies, imperatives and 
feelings” ([<a title="" href="#B12-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">12</a>],
 p. 196). However, this was not always as easy as we hoped. As David 
reached the southern boundary of the golf course at Pollock Park, his 
route was blocked by a high metal fence:
	  </p><blockquote><p>My dilemma is whether to add more miles to my 
journey by trailing the perimeter looking for an exit, or to attempt to 
cross into the adjoining field. The solution presents itself as I notice
 a missing railing which I suspect has been removed deliberately to open
 up a walking route. I make my way through woodland and clamber over 
another lower fence and land in squelchy mud. Following the high wire 
fencing that separates the field from the M77, I enjoy a feeling of 
subversion and recall Braidotti’s vision of nomadism as ‘the intense 
desire to go trespassing’ ([<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>],
 p. 66). Whether or not this is strictly trespassing, it is a moment 
that embodies the spirit of this journey, moving against prescribed uses
 of space and reimagining my route as a space of creativity and 
transgression. However, just as I cast myself as the heroic 
psychogeographer, I come face to face with a large highland cow. Its 
menacing stare, sharp horns and slow, deliberate movement towards me 
make me nervous and I look around for an exit route in case things turn 
nasty. Unfortunately, I am now too far from my entry point to retreat, 
and the section of fence that I am beside is too high to easily climb 
over. The cow lunges forward and a surge of adrenaline catapults me over
 the fence before I have time to think. On my way over, I scratch my 
shin and slightly cut my finger. Writing up my notes almost exactly a 
week later, the cut is still faintly visible - a corporeal document of 
this encounter [<a title="" href="#B34-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">34</a>].</p></blockquote><p></p><p>These
 moments of pushing, testing or breaking the body punctuated our walks, 
which were defined by physical endurance as much as situationist 
escapism. Opening up the possibility of corporeal intrusion into our 
commutes provided an alternative to Sennett’s passive commuter bodies [<a title="" href="#B6-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">6</a>].
 Over the following months, we took this part of our investigations a 
step further as David cycled to work, and Laura considered ways to 
negotiate the Clyde Estuary.</p></section><section id="sec5-humanities-04-00476" type=""><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  5. Swimming (LB)</h2><p>The
 27-mile walk I did in March 2014 had been a very enjoyable experience: 
the day was sunny and warm and I took great pleasure in noticing 
elements of my journey that the usual pace does not allow. “Walking is 
pedestrian” as Smith says and despite the blisters at the end of the 
longest day of walking I have ever done, I was aware that it was just <span class="html-italic">walking</span> ([<a title="" href="#B39-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">39</a>],
 p. 14). Most people can journey by foot and walk from A to B and I had 
not undertaken any specific training for my epic day of walking from 
dawn till dusk. The sea-swim, however, was a different story and the 
sense of anticipation and fear around undertaking this physical 
challenge seemed to grow as my various attempts at swimming from Gourock
 to Dunoon (across the Clyde Estuary where my ferry crosses) were 
usurped. Initially I had hoped to complete the swim prior to David’s and
 my visit to Lapland in April for a mobile train conference [<a title="" href="#B40-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">40</a>],
 however freezing temperatures and rough seas at this time of year made 
this impossible. I intended to swim the Clyde on the 28 June as part of 
an organised sea-swim and had ventured out in my wetsuit for some trial 
swims with my dad rowing alongside me in his dinghy in case I 
encountered difficulty. After training in the local pool, my first 
sea-swim was a pleasant surprise. The water was a reasonable 
temperature, there was nothing awful floating by and I tried very hard 
not to think of what might be happening in the deep black murk below. 
One day I even had a friendly seal swimming alongside me and the sense 
of pervading dread I had felt since I decided to do the swim began to 
recede. Every day since I made the decision to swim the ferry journey I 
had looked slightly differently at the body of water I crossed on the 
boat each morning and evening, assessing the waves, the tides, and what I
 might be sharing the water with. One week before the event I ended up 
in hospital with a soft tissue infection in my leg and made the decision
 not to do the organised swim. Disappointed and immobile I asked my dad 
to accompany me later in the summer in his boat so I could complete the 
task I had set myself.</p><p>As the warm summer weather dwindled there 
was one weekend left at the end of August which would be suitable and 
the 23 August was decided as the date for my next (and final) attempt. 
The morning was calm and I travelled to my parent’s house at 8:00 a.m. 
to set off in my dad’s boat from the West Bay to the Cloch lighthouse on
 the other side of the estuary. I think my family had hoped that by the 
end of the summer my will to do the swim would have waned and my dad had
 seemed anxious about the journey in the days prior to it. When we 
launched from the West Bay to motor the boat across, almost immediately 
we lost a small part of the outboard motor in the water. I stripped to 
my wetsuit and dived into the freezing sea to try to retrieve it but to 
no avail. This sobering start meant that we had to try to find another 
part for the motor but after several attempts we realised that it was 
not going to work and my dad began the process of rowing us across the 
sea. What I did not realise at the time was that in one of the attempts 
to start the outboard motor my dad had staved his middle finger but he 
did not tell me this as we embarked upon our slow transition across the 
estuary, nor would he let me row so I did not exert myself before the 
swim. Due to our slow and calamitous start we did not reach the far side
 and the Cloch lighthouse where I had intended to start but with this in
 near sight, I lowered my already soggy wet-suited body back into the 
water to begin the swim back to land. I filmed part of this swim using a
 camera attached to my head, but, like David’s experience of filming 
when cycling (see below), the film is skewed, a sideways shot of the 
blue sky peppered with fluffy clouds with a triangular sliver of sea 
sloping across one side of the screen. The occasional shot of my dad in 
his dinghy comes into view as I turn to speak to him as we assure each 
other we are alright. Although the swim was tiring and I subsequently 
caught a chill (probably from having to dive into the water sooner than 
intended and then sit in a damp wetsuit while we rowed out) I remember 
thinking as I was doing it how much I love being in the sea. The 
buoyancy of your body that the salt water provides makes for an 
exhilarating feeling of floating. At times I felt as though I had to 
really push my fins into the sea in order to propel myself forward as 
they felt as though they were continually floating upwards towards the 
blue sky as though seeking air. Back at shore, the relief was palpable, 
no one had died in the attempt (as my sister had feared) and although we
 did not make it from point A to point B as intended, I felt as though I
 had swam enough of the journey to justify having done it. Afterwards, I
 thought about my dad. I had not realised how stressful my attempt at 
doing this would be for him. Watching the video back I think about his 
finger and how he did not tell me about it because he did not want to 
disappoint me in not being able to complete the journey I was so eager 
to do. I also reflected on how rarely in these re-imaginings have the

 to the old maxim, “it’s just like riding a bike”, the skill of cycling,
 once learned, is never forgotten. As I had not cycled for many years, I
 reassured myself with this thought as I set off on 11 May 2014 from 
Glasgow to Ayr on a borrowed old mountain bike with a Go-Pro camera 
fixed to the handle bar. As it turns out, cycling is not at all like 
riding a bike. I nervously manoeuvred my way through Finnieston and 
across the River Clyde, brakes squealing and wheels wobbling. At some 
point in the first few minutes, unnoticed by me, a jolt knocked the 
camera out of position and for most of the rest of the journey only my 
anxious face can be seen, framed by the overcast sky (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f008" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 8</a>).</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f008">

</div><p>Before long, the bike and I fell into our stride. I corrected 
the camera angle, breathed in the cold spring air and propelled myself 
forward into the route. Sometime later, just north of Moscow (yes, there
 is an Ayrshire village called Moscow!) hail stones the size of grapes 
began to shoot from the sky as the weather turned savage—reddening my 
exposed legs and soaking me in freezing rainwater. I searched in vain 
for a shelter and eventually found an old barn where I sheltered for a 
few minutes. As I waited I realised that the muddy ground was swarming 
with insects crawling out of the deluge into the safety of the manmade 
structure. I weighed one discomfort against the other and decided to 
plough on through the downpour (I could hardly get any wetter).</p><p>Cycling
 occupies the middle ground between walking and driving: fast enough to 
feel a tangible sense of progress at any given moment; but slow enough 
to feel a corporeal connection to the landscape. I remember this journey
 vividly a year later. The exhilaration of the wind in my face as I sped
 downhill along country lanes, the mud splattering all over me, and the 
chilling soaking as I approached Ayr. As an extremely irregular cyclist,
 I do not have a sense of cycling as a mode of commuting, which can be 
perceived as just as “forgettable, ordinary, banal” as my commute by car
 ([<a title="" href="#B41-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">41</a>],
 p. 291). This experience, for me, was like Phil Ian Jones’ artistic 
experiments in route-marking by bike, and allowed me to engage with this
 form of mobility as “sweaty, visceral, emotionally intense and highly 
embodied” ([<a title="" href="#B41-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">41</a>],
 p. 291). When I arrived at my hotel later that afternoon, it was one of
 the most warming and relaxing moments of arrival that I have 
experienced. This is a welcome return from the <span class="html-italic">détournement</span> of the journey, and it reminds me of Smith’s observation that “the permanent drift disappears the drifter” ([<a title="" href="#B18-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">18</a>],
 p. 139). Returns, homecomings and finishing lines. Unlike nomadic 
journeys, all these exploratory commutes have an intended endpoint.</p></section><section id="sec7-humanities-04-00476" type=""><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  7. Boating (LB)</h2><p>In
 the Victorian era when Glasgow was the “second city” and the tobacco 
merchants were making their fortunes, the local seaside town of Dunoon 
grew as the wealthy merchants built holiday homes within sailing 
distance of the city. Dunoon became a popular holiday resort and 
steam-powered boats transported thousands of holiday makers “doon the 
watter” of the river Clyde into the Firth of Clyde for summer holidays 
and Glasgow fair weekend. This continued until the 1960s when a 
controversial American naval base was built in the nearby Holy Loch and 
the rise of cheap package holidays to warmer climes meant that the 
popularity of Dunoon as a holiday destination declined. My grandparents 
met at in Dunoon on a Glasgow fair weekend and my father spent a lot of 
his childhood holidaying in Dunoon and subsequently my sister and I 
spent many rainy summer holidays following suit. My parents moved to 
Dunoon six years ago and I moved to the nearby village of Innellan the 
year after. The faded elegance of Dunoon as a popular Victorian resort 
and the history of the town includes a shift from sea travel to 
alternative means. The Waverley is the world’s last sea-going paddle 
steamer and epitomises a mode of transport that was once the norm but is
 now all but obsolete. Almost my entire commute can be done over water 
and so I wanted to travel by boat from Glasgow through the narrow banks 
of the Clyde river in the city centre as it opens out into the Clyde 
Estuary and out to sea.</p><p>I undertook my usual commute by car, ferry
 and train to get to Glasgow on the morning of 22 August, one of the 
Waverley’s last sailings of the summer season. Boarding the boat at 
Glasgow’s Science Centre (the recent addition of new bridges over the 
city centre stretch of the Clyde makes this the closest point that 
larger vessels can travel to and from) the boat is busy with 
day-trippers heading to various seaside resorts (the steamer will stop 
at Kilcreggan, Dunoon, and Rothesay). There is something very alluring 
about the Waverley’s design and over all three levels of the steamer 
there are details of design and engineering that are notable. In the 
midsection of the boat is the engine room where the mechanics and 
workings of the engine are on display. The large paddle can be seen 
moving through the water through the portholes at each side of the boat.</p><p>The
 journey “doon the watter” is very pleasant. I stay on the port side of 
the boat so I can film the commute I do every day from the perspective 
of the water (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f009" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 9</a>).
 I am pleased to notice familiar landmarks from my walk and the shift 
from the scrapyards and building yards of the city into the yellow 
fields of Inchinnan is beautiful. Once almost at Greenock I move about 
the boat and film various parts of my journey around the steamer. We 
stop at Kilcreggan, a small village near Helensburgh, before journeying 
on to Dunoon. I think how lovely the pier looks as we approach the town 
and also think about how on my daily journey I do not look at this 
anymore, or do not see it in the way I once did. The experience of being
 on a “daytrip” on the Waverley allows me to see Dunoon as a visitor 
might on arrival. The antiquated mode of journeying has also made me 
think about Dunoon’s transition from holiday town to declining working 
town and I wonder if the tourists who visit Dunoon on the Waverley 
transport the destination back to a former identity—a seaside town 
visited for pleasure during the summer holidays as I experience it on 
this day. It was this experience that encouraged my “everyday commuting 
excursions” postcard project with designer Rachel O'Neill, where we 
wanted to use some of the nostalgic aesthetic that often appears in 
connection with the golden age of steam travel to ask contemporary boat 
travellers to reimagine and map their journeys and to see the spaces 
between home and work a-new.</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f009">

 of our mapping experiments, which Laura developed with O’Neill, was a 
set of posters and postcards encouraging commuters on the Gourock to 
Dunoon ferry to reimagine their everyday journeys as “excursions”. When 
Laura traveled down the Firth of Clyde on the Waverly Steamer in August 
2014, she acknowledged that the arrival at Dunoon ferry terminal by 
steamer as opposed to ferry made her see the Victorian pier and the town
 beyond differently. By traveling on a historic mode of transport the 
feeling of being on an “excursion” as a “daytripper” rather than a 
commuter encouraged a “seeing a-new” of the familiar site. Inspired by 
this and by the nostalgic posters portraying the golden age of steam 
travel on the Clyde situated within the newly developed Gourock train 
station, Laura wanted to engage other commuters in a creative act of 
mapping that would encourage them to reimagine their everyday journey by
 boat and to “see a-new” the space between home and work. The design of 
the materials was influenced by ferry brochures and posters from the 
1950s and commuters were asked to offer a creative response to a map 
showing the area travelled over water between the two ferry terminals. 
By obscuring the landmass and emphasising the sea using colour and 
detailed markings, the design was intended to ask people to consider 
what this space and time travelling over water could be. Participants 
mapped, drew or wrote in the space provided on the postcard to offer an 
alternative mapping of the spaces between home and work and posted it 
into a postbox on the Argyll Flyer ferry (see <a href="#fig_body_display_humanities-04-00476-f010" class="html-fig html-figpopup">Figure 10</a>).
 These responses were collated into a book which was displayed at the 
Lighthouse in Glasgow in July and the maps completed by members of the 
public can now be found on the Making Routes website [<a title="" href="#B2-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">2</a>].</p><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="humanities-04-00476-f010">

</div><p>The responses of the public were varied with some participants 
drawing feelings they had about their journey and others offering 
practical solutions for the “problem” of the journey. One postcard 
depicted an arm with a floating balloon attached over Dunoon and a ball 
and chain on an ankle for Gourock implying a feeling of lightness and 
freedom when “home” and a heaviness and responsibility connected with 
the “work” side of the map. Some of the contributions conveyed the 
history of the area with one showing a “map of memories of Clyde piers” 
with sketches of now defunct or absent piers as boat travel has become 
less popular. Others used the postcard to convey the social aspect of 
the journey with one participant writing: “The boat is a place to meet 
friends old and new” and another explaining it was a time to “exchange 
knowledge of local community events”. Some simply drew crosses on the 
map to depict the journey and one childlike drawing of a boat on the map
 was also offered. Practical solutions to some of the problems of travel
 also featured with some offering suggestions of a walkway between the 
two points and the simple statement “UNDER 18 GO FREE”, which hints at 
some of the issues young people face in Dunoon with many of the colleges
 situated over the water in Greenock. By asking commuters on the Dunoon 
to Gourock ferry to reimagine their journey as we had been doing with 
our respective commutes we were able to share our ideas with a specific 
commuting community. Encouraging people to share their “maps” (both 
literal and imaginative) also gave us an insight into how our strategies
 or prompts might also offer us new ways of thinking about our routes.</p></section><section id="sec9-humanities-04-00476" type=""><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  9. Strategies for Performance</h2><p>As
 we attempted to reimagine our commutes, the overarching aims of the 
journeys and routes remained consistent but the pace, rhythm and 
embodied experience and exertion varied greatly depending on the mode of
 travel or transport. The answers to the questions “where have you come 
from?” and “where are you going?” were always the same, and always 
interchangeable (either “home” and/or “work”) for every journey we 
undertook. Within this “formula” for these journeys we began to think of
 our experiments as strategies or variables for this predictable and 
repetitive commuting route. By varying the method by which we filled the
 space and time between “home” and “work” we were able to challenge our 
own understanding of these quotidian and functional journeys. Our 
walking, swimming and boating journeys introduced a range of approaches 
to mobility that allowed us to depart from our established rhythms and 
routes and reconsider the liminal transitory space between the fixed 
sites of “home” and “work”. The start and end points remained (roughly) 
the same, however the journeys themselves offered a space of 
possibility—of becoming—that differed for each reimagining. Furthermore,
 what started out as a relatively discursive and academic exploration of
 commuting—an attempt to apply a nomadic thought experiment to our 
regular journeys—soon became far more physically and emotionally 
affective than we had originally considered. Our deep map contains 
accounts of venturing out into woods, estuaries and country lanes, often
 inexperienced and underprepared for a range of hostile and challenging 
environments and modes of transport. This introduced unpredictability, 
risk and endurance as key elements of our journeys. This aspect of our 
experiments in commuting will benefit from further research, and opens 
up potential routes for ongoing work in this area. In this final 
section, we distil some of these experiences into a list of 
“strategies”, which are offered for others to take up our project of 
“performing the daily commute”. If these strategies lead to a greater 
degree of uncertainty, and lead those who undertake them into 
challenging situations, this is all for the better. However, be careful 
out there.

ones, we encourage the sharing of experiences and images on the Making 
Routes website [<a title="" href="#B2-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">2</a>].
 As this project continues to develop, this site will extend this 
mapping project to maintain the deep map as an open, dynamic and 
multi-layered document, rather than fixing any “findings” in this 
journal article. Nonetheless, our process so far allows us to draw some 
initial conclusions.</p></section><section id="sec10-humanities-04-00476" type="conclusions"><h2 style="font-family: Palatino Linotype,Book Antiqua,Palatino,serif;" data-nested="1">  10. Conclusions</h2><p>On
 the first day of his walk, David cheated and briefly broke the task of 
his continuous journey on foot, returning by taxi to his home rather 
than spending the night in a soulless budget hotel. The following 
morning, returning as a car passenger to resume the walk where he left 
off, he noted that he was “already thinking of [his] commute 
differently, pointing out places he walked through the day before and 
noticing features of the route of which [he] had previously been 
unaware” [<a title="" href="#B34-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">34</a>].
 Similarly, Laura noted her aspiration that the walk would allow her to 
“re-experience my commute in an active and embodied way” in order to 
“emancipate” herself from what Braidotti refers to as “the inertia of 
everyday routines” [<a title="" href="#B36-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">36</a>].
 Our experiments in commuting have shown potential in this respect as 
both of us feel that applying our various performative experiments to 
our commutes, has changed the way we experience our daily journeys in 
several important ways. The postcard project “everyday commuting 
excursions” also allowed us to encourage commuters on the Dunoon to 
Gourock ferry to creatively map their thoughts and to reflect on these 
routine journeys and what the space between home and work means to them.</p><p>First,
 although we continue to follow the same roads, railways and ferry 
routes, we no longer feel as limited by, or contained within, these 
prescribed patterns. We have developed the appetite and tools to go “off
 route”. In this sense, we have inserted “nomadic shifts” into our 
regular journeys [<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>].
 While the sites of “home” and “work” remain fixed, by applying the 
first strategy to “alter the pace of your commute to take from dawn 
until dusk, or for a full weekend, week, month or year” the time and 
space in between these places has been opened up to the possibility of a
 deeper engagement with the landscapes we previously (and continually) 
traversed at great speed.</p><p>Second, Braidotti’s insights into 
nomadism as a way of reimagining subjectivity have allowed us to 
consider the commute in terms of “becoming” [<a title="" href="#B20-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">20</a>].
 The change in time and space as we travel these repetitive routes 
provides a liminal space for commuters to be always changing through new
 encounters and experiments, even when regularity and repetition are the
 dominant modes of engagement with a particular route. The sense of 
departing, moving, traveling and arriving all indicate moving in, 
through and out of places and the transitory and fluid sense of fixed 
time and space allow for a space of creative imagining.  Strategy three:
 “undertake your commute on an obsolete/historic mode of transport” can 
assist in this exploration of time and space, as can strategy nine: 
“research the history of your route and re-enact previous travellers’ 
experiences”. All of the “findings” from these exploratory journeys 
deepen the historical and geographical range of the map.</p><p>Third, we
 have encountered multiple rhythms that are co-present with our 
commutes, whether synchronously or asynchronously. Our walking, cycling,
 swimming and boating journeys have offered us an opportunity to 
encounter this rhythmic multiplicity beyond those elements that are 
foregrounded during our regular commutes. The physical exertions of our 
alternative commutes have allowed for an understanding of the rhythms of
 the body in relation to the landscape we have moved through depending 
on how we travelled. We have attempted to capture this rhythmic variety 
through our mapping process, moving from anecdotal to academic registers
 and shifting our mode of documentation as we travel.</p><p>Fourth, we 
have engaged in our commutes in a more embodied way and pushed ourselves
 beyond the ostensibly passive bodily experience of commuting. Smith 
says “the walk can bring you and your body into new connections through 
its aches, blisters, shivering and sweating, dehydration in intense 
heat, dizziness, pain, exhaustion, alienation” ([<a title="" href="#B39-humanities-04-00476" class="html-bibr">39</a>],
 p. 62). David’s exhaustion and painful legs from cycling allowed him a 
new appreciation of rest and shelter, while Laura’s fear of whether she 
would physically be able to complete the sea swim and this challenge 
moved her beyond her perceived bodily capabilities. These journeys have 
helped us develop an understanding of a more overtly corporeal 
engagement with the space of our commutes. We had the cuts, bruises and 
blisters to prove it—a form of deep map temporarily etched into our 
bodies.</p><p>As we continue our research in this area, we will find new
 ways to reimagine and map our regular journeys, as we aspire to become 
(more) nomadic commuters. We are going to keep journeying together and 
hope to explore the potential of the repetition of our journeys over a 
much longer period of time. What is it for a body to move between two 
places repeatedly? What is the “change” or “becoming” within the body 
through this process? By deep mapping our commutes we have learned more 
about the places we move through, our personal narratives and 
perspectives on our travels and how our experience and memory provides a
 sense of seeing anew the journeys we do every day. The idea of 
“mapping” has been literally explored through Laura’s experiments on the
 ferry where she asked people to “map” their journey while undertaking 
the boat journey from Dunoon to Gourock, but the framework of “deep 
mapping” has allowed us to conceptually map our journeys through a 
series of embodied alternative experiences opening up the possibility of
 transgression and reimagining. The challenge for us now is to keep the 
map open and evolving in order to maintain a sense of our commutes as 
spaces of becoming, and to continue to reimagine what our journeys are 
and the potential of what they could be.</p></section>
