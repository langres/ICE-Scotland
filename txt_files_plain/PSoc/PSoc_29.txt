Men 'better at stubbing out habit of 
    smoking'
Men are better at quitting smoking than women, despite 
    women being keener to kick the habit, a study has 
    found.
The research found that socio-economic status played a part in 
    how successful people were at giving up cigarettes, as well as 
    gender and age. Older smokers were better able to quit, while those 
    in more disadvantaged groups found it tougher.
Researchers from the National Institute for Health and Clinical 
    Excellence (NICE) and the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies 
    (UKCTCS) looked at studies from between 1990 and 2007 to determine 
    success rates for NHS services helping smokers to quit.
They found while women may be highly motivated to quit, they are 
    actually less likely to succeed than men.
This could be down to lower confidence in quitting and 
    differences between the sexes in the role tobacco plays in their 
    lives. Pregnancy can also see women starting the habit again once 
    the child is born.
Amongst those working in shift and manual work smoking was more 
    prevalent and in more deprived areas smoking was perceived as the 
    norm - making quitting more difficult.
Fewer smokers looked to the NHS for help in quitting in 
    disadvantaged areas (52.6 per cent) than elsewhere (57.9 per cent), 
    although the proportion of those treated for smoking related 
    illnesses was higher (16.7 per cent to 13.4 per cent).
Those from poorer areas were slightly more successful in giving 
    up (8.8 per cent to 7.8 per cent).
Researchers called for more tailored intervention to take into 
    account the circumstances of those attempting to quit.
A NICE spokesman said: "The UK remains the only 
    country to have comprehensive, free-at-the-point-of-use cessation 
    services and the study suggests these services do provide effective 
    support."
