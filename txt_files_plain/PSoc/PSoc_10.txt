 Lung cancer rates among women on rise 
    due to 80s adverts
LUNG cancer rates for women are soaring as result of targeted 
    advertising by tobacco companies in the 1980s.
While fewer men are being diagnosed with lung cancer, the deadly 
    disease is still rising among women.
The new figures show that between 2004 and 2014 incidence of 
    lung cancer among Scottish men dropped by 13.9% but rose in women 
    by 10.7%.
Gregor McNie, Cancer Research UK’s senior public affairs manager 
    in Scotland, said this reflected trends in the popularity of 
    smoking. He said: “Male smoking peaked in the 1970s and 
    started declining at that point. For women it was more in the 
    1980s.
“Also tobacco marketing focused more on women in the 
    1980s, targeting housewives.
“The lung cancer rates are a decade behind for 
    women.”

If the figures are adjusted for age, incidence of cancer in 
    general dropped by 3% for men but increased by 6% for women over 
    the decade to 2014.
This is party driven by the lung cancer discrepancy, but breast 
    cancer, cervix and womb cancer have all risen among women. The 
    report issued by the information arm of NHS Scotland linked these 
    increases to breast screening identifying more tumours, women 
    giving birth later in life and having fewer children, higher rates 
    of obesity and alcohol consumption.
A charity has warned Scotland's cancer support system 
    "isn't working" and called for a new Scottish 
    Government plan amid figures showing cases have risen by 14% in ten 
    years.
Macmillan in Scotland said the figures are "a stark 
    reminder of the growing number of people being diagnosed with 
    cancer".
With three-quarters of cancers diagnosed in people aged 60 and 
    over, Macmillan said the figures illustrate the pressures of an 
    ageing population.
In 2014, 31,711 people in Scotland were diagnosed with cancer, 
    up from 27,820 ten years ago, according to figures from the NHS 
    Information Services Division (ISD Scotland).
Rates have decreased by 3% for men to 15,528 but increased by 6% 
    for women to 16,183.
Lung cancer remains the most common cancer in Scotland, with 
    5,307 diagnoses in 2014, followed by breast cancer (4,610) and 
    colorectal cancer (3,721).
Lung cancer has fallen 14% in males but risen 11% in females, 
    reflecting historic trends in the prevalence of smoking which have 
    differed between men and women, according to ISD Scotland.
Breast cancer has risen by 7%, partly due to increased screening 
    and detection, but the rise in older mothers, falling family size, 
    obesity and alcohol are all thought to be contributing factors.
