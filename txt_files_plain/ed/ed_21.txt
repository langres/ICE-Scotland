SNP must face economic realities

We live in hard times. Austerity rains down upon us, public 
    services are under great strain, local councils face unprecedented 
    cuts – all forced upon us by dastardly Tories like George Osborne 
    and mean-spirited Liberal Democrats like Danny Alexander. It is all 
    the fault of an out-of-touch Westminster.
Well, that’s how the Scottish Government likes to present it. 
    Social justice secretary Alex Neil says Scottish public spending 
    has been “slashed to ribbons”. Inconveniently for the SNP and 
    Labour, who have both invested heavily in this same anti-austerity 
    narrative, the truth is somewhat different.
In real terms the Scottish budget for 2015-16 is the second 
    highest it has ever had at its disposal since the Scottish 
    Parliament came into being almost 16 years ago. Interestingly the 
    largest budget was also during another year of “austerity”, back in 
    2009-10.
