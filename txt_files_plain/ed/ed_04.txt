    republicanism

Kate and baby George are having a triumphant tour of 
    New Zealand and Australia.
This threesome have done more to halt the spread of 
    republicanism than anyone has for years.
The Aussies remember William smiling as a baby on a blanket with 
    his parents Charles and Diana.
Now he’s back as a dad with a bright-eyed son who is collecting 
    furry toys by the plane load. But it’s Kate who deserves a lot of 
    the admiration.
How does she do it? No post pregnancy baby bulges in evidence. 
    Instead she steps sprightly down the stairs of an aircraft in 
    killer heels, chic and trendy outfits, clutching George to her 
    chest.
Any new mum of a nine month old baby knows what an exhausting 
    time it is. They still wake in the night for a feed. They’re into 
    everything.
You need to change their clothes several times a day. They make 
    a beeline crawling towards anything invitingly messy. Your clothes 
    are permanently food stained.
Last week my son and daughter in law made the three hour flight 
    from Portugal with Elizabeth Anne, born in the same week as Prince 
    George.
Mum and dad were anxious. Their first time on holiday with a new 
    baby. What if she disturbed other passengers? Had they brought all 
    the right things? Was anything missing from the baby bag?
She took to it like the manor born, charming flight attendants 
    with her smiles, beaming at everyone and enjoying her pureed 
    apples.
Babies are amazingly resilient, whether Royal or not. They take 
    new experiences in their stride.
But I bet Kate will be glad when it’s all over and she can get 
    back home to playing on the floor with George in her comfy jeans, 
    with nothing more demanding to think about than where to store all 
    those furry kangaroos.
