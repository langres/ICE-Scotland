 Obama must act on Gaza
ONCE again the world is left shocked by violence 
    erupting in Gaza.
Once again it does not know how to respond to a situation which 
    seems incapable of solution - for the sorry truth is, both sides 
    have a smidgen of right on their side.
The Israelis have been under sustained bombardment by Hamas and 
    it is only right that they should safeguard their own people. 
    Equally, the Palestinians also have a right to live without fear of 
    violence. Common sense suggests that both sides should sit down and 
    broker an agreement before more lives are lost but in this part of 
    the world common sense is in short supply. There is too much 
    ancient history at work and too many recent grievances have soured 
    people's minds. Israel claims that it has the right to 
    self-defence but by the same token the Palestinians and Hamas must 
    have the same right to resist an occupation that is now almost half 
    a century old.
There was a time when violence of this kind would have triggered 
    a response in Washington and encouraged intervention. But those 
    days are gone. Peace in Israel is no longer a major issue in US 
    political circles and the "special relationship" is 
    honoured only in the breach.
That is a pity because the US is the only country capable of 
    imposing the political solution that is the only answer to the 
    current crisis. For the sake of both parties this is something 
    which should involve President Barack Obama. It's time to get 
    the peace process - remember that? - back on the agenda.
