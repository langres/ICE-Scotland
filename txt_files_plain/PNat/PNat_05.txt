Insects in decline as humans abound
NUMBERS of insects and other invertebrates such as 
    spiders, crustaceans and worms have nearly halved in 35 years as 
    the human population has doubled, a study warns.
The decline in invertebrate numbers mirrors similar reductions 
    elsewhere in the animal kingdom as humans have triggered 
    catastrophic disasters and population declines that have put the 
    world into a "sixth mass extinction".
Around two thirds of monitored invertebrate species have seen a 
    decline in numbers of 45 per cent on average, the study published 
    in the journal Science said.
The falls in invertebrate numbers came as a surprise to 
    scientists, who had thought they were more resilient than larger 
    species such as birds and mammals.
Their decline poses a major problem as they help provide 
    important services in the natural cycle from pollination and pest 
    control for crops to water filtration and breaking down plant and 
    animal matter to return nutrients to the ground.
The scientists, led by University College London and Stanford 
    and UCSB in the US, said the decrease in invertebrate numbers was 
    due to two main factors - habitat loss and increasingly the impact 
    of disruption to the climate.
Dr Ben Collen, from UCL, said: "We were shocked to 
    find similar losses in invertebrates as with larger animals, as we 
    previously thought invertebrates to be more resilient. We are in 
    the potentially dangerous position of losing integral parts of 
    ecosystems without knowing what roles they play in 
    it."
