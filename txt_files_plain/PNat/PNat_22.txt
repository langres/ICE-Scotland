New technology helps ease pain of injections for children 
    
 The Sick Kids Friends Foundation 
    recently funded just under �2000 to 
    supply 43 "Buzzy" kits across different departments at 
    the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. 
AN Edinburgh based charity has funded an innovative 
    new technology in Edinburgh hospitals which helps ease the pain of 
    injections for children.
Designed to look like a bee and appropriately named Buzzy, the 
    impressive equipment eliminates or dulls the sharp pain of 
    injections by confusing the body’s own nerves and distracting 
    attention away from the needle.

The Sick Kids Friends Foundation (SKFF), which supports and 
    complements the work of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC) 
    in Edinburgh, recently allocated just under £2,000 of funding to 
    supply 43 Buzzy kits across different departments in the hospital 
    which provide a drug free pain relief for children.
Imogen Kelly, paediatric and adolescent rheumatology nurse 
    specialist at the RHSC said: “Buzzy is absolutely fantastic. 
    It’s a very cute vibrating bee with ice pack wings which decreases 
    sharp pain, so it is great for the children.
“Rheumatology patients often have to have weekly 
    injections, so it’s a fantastic way of making these as painless as 
    possible.
“Most importantly they are fun and they are a distraction 
    for kids who unfortunately have to spend a lot of time receiving 
    jabs.”
Used for children aged up to 18, SKFF have provided the RHSC 
    with Buzzy kits in the Diabetes department, Surgical Day Case Unit 
    and the Asthma clinic as well as funding a distraction kit for the 
    Children’s Ward at St John’s.
Pippa Johnston, Director of Fundraising and Marketing at SKFF, 
    said: “The SKFF exist to transform the experiences of 
    children and young people in hospital so they can be a child first 
    and a patient second and the Buzzy kits fit perfectly into this 
    aim.
“Receiving an injection can be not only painful for a 
    child but also very frightening. We are delighted we have been able 
    to supply this equipment in so many departments at the RHSC to try 
    and better these experiences as much as possible.”
SKFF distributes around £1.5m per 
    year at RHSC and other children and young people’s community 
    healthcare settings.
