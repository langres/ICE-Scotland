Scottish seals steer clear of wind turbines, study shows 
    
 Seals will stay 20km away from wind 
    farm construction. 
Seals will give a wide berth to offshore wind farms 
    during the noisiest phase of construction, according to new 
    Scottish research.
Scientists at the University of St Andrews used GPS telemetry 
    tags to study the behaviour of protected harbour seals before, 
    during and after offshore wind farm construction and operation.
Results showed the mammals will move around 20km away from the 
    site while pile-driving work to attach turbines to the seabed is 
    under way but return to the area afterwards.
Previous research has shown that pile-driving sounds may be loud 
    enough to cause hearing damage in seals so moving away from the 
    source may prove to have benefits.
However, such avoidance can result in the seals, which have been 
    declining in recent years, being unable to access important feeding 
    areas.
Researchers say the findings have important implications for the 
    wind farm planning consent process and could inform strategies to 
    minimise the impact of offshore schemes on wildlife.
Study leader Dr Debbie Russell, from the Sea Mammal Research 
    Unit at the university, said: â€œSeals are protected by European law 
    and our findings will be used by the regulators and the marine 
    renewables industry to more accurately predict the effect of 
    particular wind farms on seals.
