Scottish ‘Data Lab’ to harness big data
An innovation centre is to be launched this year aimed 
    at bringing business, academia and the public sector together to 
    exploit new developments in data analytics. 
Backed by £11.3 million of public 
    finance, the Data Lab is expected to revolutionise the way in which 
    Scottish industry uses “big data” to capture 
    new market opportunities and boost productivity. 
Its focus will be to “improve our lives” by 
    targeting such things as efficient energy use, personalised online 
    shopping and more effective medical care. 
Data Lab’s supporters say it will create at least 345 jobs and 
    generate £155 million for the economy. It is funded by the Scottish 
    Funding Council (SFC) and has additional support from Scottish 
    Enterprise and Highlands & Islands Enterprise. 
The centre will build on innovation in the university sector and 
    is expected to “transform the way in which industry, public 
    sector and academic institutions collaborate”, and will 
    have hub locations in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Data Lab’s 
    focus will be on the digital technology, energy, financial 
    services, healthcare and public sector markets. Laurence Howells, 
    chief executive of the SFC, said: “We all use and generate 
    massive amounts of data each day. Our investment will support the 
    Data Lab to develop innovative techniques that will improve many 
    aspects of our lives.” 
Neil Logan, chairman of the Data Lab said it would 
    “unlock the value inside our world leading academic 
    institutions”.
