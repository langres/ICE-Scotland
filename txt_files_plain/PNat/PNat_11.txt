Reflexology - is it a myth or marvel?

Millions of us take paracetamol to get rid of a 
    headache.
Most of us don’t know exactly how it takes the pain away, but it 
    does.
And it’s the same with reflexology — although here even the 
    experts can’t decide exactly how it works!
“There are countless ways it may work, we just can’t 
    prove any of them scientifically yet,” says Tracey Smith, 
    Reflexology and Research Manager for the Association of 
    Reflexologists (AoR).
“The concept of foot maps and hand maps is agreed, the 
    fact it has an effect on the body is agreed — but how has not yet 
    been fully explained.
“It works with energy pathways, and reflexology’s simply 
    all about releasing that energy.
“The theory is it increases the blood flow to the related 
    part of the body.
“It’s also thought we work through the ‘pain gate’ 
    theory.
“For example, if you bang your knee and rub your knee, 
    the rubbing feeling gets to the brain first so it takes away some 
    of the pain.
“It can be astonishing what reflexology allows the body 
    to do. It takes away and unlocks stress and allows the body to do 
    its natural healing, which is what it wants to do.
“I had a lady come in to say she was seeing an 
    orthopaedic surgeon for a back operation in six weeks’ time, what 
    did I think I could do?
“She saw me once a week for the six weeks and on her last 
    visit, I asked if she was still having the back operation and she 
    said: ‘No, I don’t need it.’
“There have been many clients who would say similar 
    things and that’s just the way reflexology sometimes works in some 
    people.
“But there will be a few who say: ‘Reflexology didn’t 
    work for me’ and they won’t come back.
