  Study finds curry each week can stave 
    off dementia
EATING curry at least once a week may help ward off dementia, 
    according to new research.
The study shows that a spicy ingredient in the dish boosts brain 
    power and protects against memory loss in old age.
Curcumin, the key chemical in turmeric used in everything from 
    mild kormas to the hottest vindaloos, is believed to delay or 
    prevent dementia symptoms.
A study of middle aged and elderly people found those who popped 
    a capsule of the stuff three times a day had better memories than 
    those given a dummy pill.
It adds to evidence that older people living in cultures where 
    curry is a staple have better cognitive function and a lower 
    prevalence of dementia.
The yellow spice turmeric was identified as the most probable 
    reason for this – thanks to curcumin.
The year-long trial published in the British Journal of 
    Nutrition found evidence curcumin blocks rogue proteins called beta 
    amyloid which clumps together and destroys neurons.
In the study 96 participants aged between 40 and 90 were given 
    either a daily placebo or 1,500 mg of curcumin for 12 months.
In tests of verbal and memory skills, those taking the dummy 
    pill suffered a decline in mental function after just six months 
    that was not observed in those having the curcumin.
Dr Stephanie Rainey-Smith, of Edith Cowan University, Perth, 
    Australia, said: “Curcumin therapy in animals has produced 
    positive cognitive and behavioural outcomes; results of human 
    trials, however, have been inconsistent.”
“In this study, we report the results of a 12-month, 
    randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study that 
    investigated the ability of a curcumin formulation to prevent 
    cognitive decline in a population of community-dwelling older 
    adults.”
