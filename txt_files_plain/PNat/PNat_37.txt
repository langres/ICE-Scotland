Rise in deadly lungworm parasite 
 Cases of lungworm are on the 
    increase.
New figures have revealed that the parasite lungworm 
    which targets dogs has been found in nearly every county in the 
    UK.
Lungworm was first detected in South Wales and Cornwall in the 
    late 1970s, but has now reached most of the UK, including Northern 
    Ireland and the majority of Scotland.
A rise in warmer, wetter weather is believed to be partly to 
    blame for the growth, as it has led to an increase in slugs and 
    snails, which are the most common hosts of the lungworm parasite. 
    
Vets are now offering advice to dog owners on how to best keep 
    their dogs safe and protected from the parasite.
Dr Huw Stacey, director of clinical service at Vets4Pets, said: 
    “Dogs love to roam around and explore the outdoors, so can 
    easily come into contact with the infected slugs and 
    snails,” said Dr Stacey.
“If this happens, the larvae are absorbed in the dog’s 
    gut and develop into adults which live between the heart and lungs, 
    until they are coughed up and swallowed, then the whole cycle 
    begins again.”
Signs that a dog is infected by the lungworm parasite can 
    include coughing, breathlessness, weight loss, reduced appetite, 
    diarrhoea and in more severe cases, fits, impaired blood clotting 
    and haemorrhage.
Dr Stacey added: “These signs are not a sure guarantee of 
    lungworm, so if your dog is displaying any of these symptoms, it is 
    essential to take them into your local vet so further tests can be 
    done to reach a diagnosis.” 
“Luckily there are a number of simple treatments, 
    including a spot-on-product or tablets, which are easy to 
    administer and very effective at protecting dogs against lungworm. 
    Owners should be vigilant of their dogs.”
