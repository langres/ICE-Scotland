New fly discovered on Perthshire wildlife reserve
A species of fly has been recorded for 
    the first time in the UK.
A NEW species of fly has been recorded in the UK for the first 
    time, after it was discovered on a Perthshire wildlife reserve.
Two female specimens of the fly, known as the Platypalpus 
    aliterolamellatus Kovalev, were found on the Scottish Wildlife 
    Trust’s Tummel Shingle Islands reserve near Pitlochry.
The insect is a small predatory fly that feeds on other insects 
    and were swept from the vegetation on one site called Ballinluig 
    Island.
Measuring two millimetres in length, they need to be identified 
    from a high-powered microscope and can be distinguished by the tiny 
    bristles on their heads, and the shape of their legs and feet.
The discovery was made by Stephen Hewitt, a research fellow in 
    Entomology at National Museums Scotland, who is studying the flies 
    that live on river shingle-banks.
Mr Hewitt said: "It wasn’t too surprising to find a 
    new species on Ballinluig Island because it is recognised as one of 
    the best sites of its kind in Britain.
"Shingle banks are a fairly localised habitat that 
    can be damaged by trampling from people and livestock, as well as 
    gravel extraction.
"It’s important to know what is out there so that we 
    can identify the best sites and protect them for the 
    future."
Shingle banks provide an environment where invertebrates and 
    over 400 species of plants thrive, as well as a wide variety of 
    birds such as oystercatchers, common terns and redshanks.
The Platypalpus aliterolamellatus Kovalev was first discovered 
    in 1971 and has been found elsewhere in Europe including 
    Switzerland and Sweden.
The discovery is published in the Dipterists Digest, the journal 
    of the Society for the study of flies.
