Statins found to lower risk of Alzheimer's 
    disease

STATINS taken by millions of Britons to lower their cholesterol 
    reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, a study 
    found.
Taking the daily tablets at least six months a year for at least 
    two years reduced the risk of Alzheimer’s by 15 per cent for women 
    and 12 per cent for men.
But the protective effect depends on the type of statin and race 
    of the patient, the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, 
    found.
Assistant Professor Dr Julie Zissimopoulos said: “To our 
    knowledge, no effective treatments exist for Alzheimer disease, and 
    new molecules are years away. However, several drugs prescribed for 
    other conditions have been associated with reducing its 
    risk.”
Previous research into statins and Alzheimer’s showed “a 
    protective association” but there had been shortcomings.
The new study analysed the records of 400,000 patients 
    prescribed four commonly prescribed statins – simvastatin, 
    atorvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin.
It found from 2009 to 2013, 1.72 per cent of women and 1.32 per 
    cent of men received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s annually.
But white men had the lowest incidence of Alzheimer’s at 1.23 
    per cent, while fewer black and Hispanic people took statins 
    compared to white people.
The incidence of Alzheimer’s was higher among Hispanic and black 
    women – 2.29 per cent and 2.11 per cent, respectively – than white 
    women – 1.64 per cent.
White men had the lowest incidence of Alzheimer’s (1.23 per 
    cent), lower than that of “other” race women (1.37 per cent) and 
    men (1.29 per cent).
