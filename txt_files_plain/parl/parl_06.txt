the final item of business today is a member's business debate on motion number five nine four four in the name of Hanzala Malik on challenging negative racial and religious stereotypes this debate will be concluded without any questions being put and I'd be greatful if those members who wish to participate in the debate could please press the request-to-speak buttons now I call in Hanzala Malik to open the debate seven minutes please Mister Malik many thanks  now turn to the open part of the debate speeches of four minutes please and I'm going to call Malcolm Chisholm first because he has indicated as a courtesy to the chamber that he has to leave early for other parliamentary business Malcolm Chisholm to be followed by Dennis Robertson thank you very much I now call Dennis Robertson to be followed by Anne McTaggart erm thank you Presiding Officer but I've apologised to the minister can I repeat my apologies to you and indeed to Hanzala Malik coz I have to leave to chair the cross-party group on cancer which starts soon erm I'd like to congratulate Hanzala Malik for bringing forward what is a very important motion and also  congratulate Amina Muslim Women’s Resource Centre for all the great work they've done I know over a period of several years but in the context of this debate erm congratulate them for their campaign I speak for myself  I've no doubt other members have erm looked into this and seen the the film that's available erm online and I certainly hope that as many people as possible will watch that film and promote it erm so that erm other people erm become aware of it I think their campaign was always important for the reasons that Hanzala Malik has erm given but I think we would also agree that it's particularly timely after the appalling crime erm in erm Woolwich as we all know people of all religions and none erm commit erm crimes erm but a pac- particular crime can never be an excuse for turning erm on a a community an innocent community who happen to share the erm criminal’s religion and this unfortunately has happened over the last erm few weeks I was at a community workshop in my constituency two weeks ago and erm i- it's a great group by the way who are who're working to promote race equality and integration in north Edinburgh but it was very sad to hear one of the M- Muslim women at that meeting say that she'd lived erm in her community in north Edinburgh for six years and never until the week before had she ever actually been harassed and she described a a a a a very terrifying incident when she was on her bicycle so we have to face facts there has been a recent rise in racism and Islamophobia and the prejudice and stereotyping that we know exist  has been exacerbated so we have to erm address that problem and certainly this great campaign erm from erm Amina erm Muslim  Women’s Resource Centre can help us to do that because I think what we need to do is to listen to individual Muslim women and men and obviously as much as possible erm relate to them and that's what the message of integration is about  so that we actually live together in harmony and break down the barriers and the prejudices and the stereotypes that get in the way of our living in harmony now in the kind of we have been reminded of what happened back in nine erm two thousand and five if we remember the London bombings and in the wake of that there was the same kind of  erm increase in erm in racism and Islamo- Islamophobia and it also reminded me erm of a group in my own constituency I hope Hanzala Malik won't mind me mentioning this but they in the wake of that produced a booklet which I've got here called  Pride and Prejudice Beyond the Veil but I was reminded of that because in s- to some extent the women who did that they were called the Pakeeza women's group were trying to do the same kind of thing that the erm Amina Women Cet- Resource Centre women are trying to do now they were trying to say to others this is who I am this is the kind of person I'm see beyond the fact that I may or may not wear a veil see beyond the the stereotyping and the prejudices that are so common in society and in the media this is who I am I'm a human being I have these interests I'm just like you in very many ways although they were also saying  in this booklet as in the  Amina campaign I do have a particular religion I want you to know about this religion because of course a lot of the prejudice and stereot- t- typing is about the Islamic faith and that is misrepresented and associated erm with violence and so on which is totally in- erm appropriate so let's listen to these erm erm erm women I hope the media will also listen because a lot of responsibility rests on them erm for reporting these things in in in very erm unhelpful and derogatory and prejudiced ways erm and we should all work together to to challenge the myths and the stereotypes to t- to bring about a society where we can c- live in harmony and I hope we can  more and more do it at community level as I'm pleased to say is happening in my own constituency thank you very much Presiding Officer and erm I too will congratulate Hanzala Malik for bringing this debate to the chamber Presiding Officer I've always found it difficult to understand prejudice erm and erm the the reason being that I'm I've been blessed with having Nigerian cousins since I I was the age of about six erm which was over fifty years ago and I've also got Mauritian cousins and as I say I've always found it difficult to understand this whole concept around erm erm prejudice and when Hanzala was bringing this to the chamber I suddenly had a flashback it was a memory that came back to me that when I was at school here in Edinburgh  and the reason I want to share this memory with you is that it was a young lad who was thirteen fourteen at the time  ages with myself and he was born totally blind without eyes so therefore he had no concept of colour but yet he had a prejudice towards black people I couldn't understand that and I find it very difficult to understand and I remember engaging with him the discussion and he says oh no no I just don’t like black people  but I was trying to explain to him but you don't know what black is you have no idea you've no concept of colour you've no concept of night and day you've no co- concept of light or dark but yet he was convinced he had this it was nigh-on hatred to some extent of people of black and ethnic minority and at that time probably we didn't speak of a ethnic minority we just spoke about black people at that time and it was because his parents were prejudiced and this is where he learned to be prejudiced against other people people he'd never met people he had no idea that he was passing in the street of their colour or ethnicity so this is why I particularly find it difficult to understand  why we have so much prejudice remaining because when we pass people in the street we have no idea and certainly I don't of people's faith I have no idea that if a person was born in this country or not  and I find it quite disturbing that twenty eight percent of the population when they're surveyed say that yes prejudice is right yes they deserve twenty eight percent are still saying that twenty eight percent are saying yes it's right to have a prejudice against certain people within our communities thirty one percent believe that people from ethnic backgrounds  are taking our jobs I can't understand that either our jobs whose jobs erm Presiding Officer as I said to start with prejudice is something I find difficult to understand and as a former member of the Equal Opportunities Committee erm we dealt a lot  with erm h- the Human Rights Commission and I remember when we were doing the erm erm Equal Opportunities Report on the Gypsy erm Travelling community and it was the Scottish Human Rights Commission said that that within the Gypsy Travelling community is the last bastion of self-respected prejudice and racism and again the percentage of people from other ethnic minority groups are also prejudiced towards the Gypsy Travelling community  again something I find because people don't understand something they have a prejudice towards it and I think this is something I think Hanzala Malik is absolutely right  and others are absolutely right that it's about education and awareness erm Malcolm Chisholm who when he's summing up said the media have a responsibility they certainly do because sometimes the way the media portray racism   and prejudice is to incite more I think we should have a responsibility to raise awareness  rather to incite thank you Presiding Officer
