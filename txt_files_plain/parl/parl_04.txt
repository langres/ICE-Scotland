many thanks I now call on John Mason to be followed by Anne McTaggert erm thank you very much for that erm I now call on Mister Mason to be followed by Anne McTaggart  oh Anne McTaggart to be followed by Stewart Stevenson  yes thank you very much and I now call on Stewart Stevenson to be followed by Margo MacDonald  Mister Stevenson a very generous six minutes Bob Doris another minute Mister Stevenson many many thanks I now call on Margo MacDonald three minutes or thereby please  you should be drawing to a close now please you are closing now erm thank you erm Presiding Officer erm I think it is very good that erm we're having this erm report that it's been carried out erm the study behind it and erm that we're able to debate it today and I do congratulate the committee for  doing that I think there is always a danger as I think it's been mentioned before that we get fixated with one or two key statistics erm for example employment or unemployment figures and these are obviously very important but we can't forget  erm to look at the detail behind the figures erm which here means  not just the employment numbers but the quality and type of employment that is actually available the fact that being in one or two  erm other committees not this one erm over the last erm year or so gives an added relevance I feel to looking at this report erm for one I'm on the Equal Opportunities Committee and we're a-  in the process of preparing a report on women and work erm so I feel I should just make a few comments erm on the issue of the gender dimension of underemployment although others erm including Alison Johnstone have mentioned that already the figures of eight point seven percent for male underemployment and eleven point three percent for female underemployment erm have to be concerning to us and on one example that has been coming up a lot at the different committees and in the different reports  is the whole area of women returning to work after having had children they're often forced to downgrade their aspirations in order to get either part-time or flexible employment  and I think we'll be- have more on this when we come to the Equal Opportunities report in due course also during the Finance Committee study on employability erm and now as I said the Equal Opportunities study on women at work the issue of skills alignment has come up and I'm glad to see that's been touched on erm this afternoon and erm certainly in the committee report on both committees we've heard reports of good work being done to encourage young people and especially it has to be said young women to think a bit out of the box and not just drift into the kind of job or training which perhaps their families  traditionally did and while higher further education establishments are important here I reckon that we do need to start earlier on it seems to me that the schools definitely have a role to play and that can include bringing people from different sectors into the schools to broaden young people's thinking coz often we have to accept that the teachers themselves erm will have had erm o- perhaps not a very broad experience of the outside work erm workplace because we're still in the situation where students with excellent qualifications for example in politics or history erm are queuing up at our doors looking for work experience while at the same time it seems that companies like Scottish Power SSE and the North Sea sector in general are crying out for engineers and similar skills so I was particularly glad to see erm paragraph erm seventy four  erm on page twenty six of the report which I would like to quote from in evidence to the committee the Cabinet Secretary confirmed the importance of the higher and further education sectors being aligned with the Scottish Government's  economic strategy he acknowledged that quote for far too long there has been a disconnect between the aspirations of the business community  with regard to where growth will come  in the economy and our education community's planning assumptions about where the emphasis should lie unquote in particular he highlighted the growth in the oil and gas renewable sector and the significant skill shortages in engineering and erm I see too that that is included as one of the conclusions at paragraph eighty two I think we should also accept that erm in some cases underemployment or even skills underutilisation are not always a bad thing for example some of my fellow accountants might feel I was currently not using all of my accounting training in the job I'm presently doing erm now that may be true to some extent but of course it is out of choice and I do consider what I am doing to be a high-quality job erm  I do think however that accountancy is a great background erm for a range of possible career options but similarly too we must not undervaluate the graduate mother or father who deliberately stays at home with their young children in order to give them what they feel is the best start of life  and I do know the committee's definition erm as I've already mentioned in the intervention  of skills until- underutilisation erm for example on page seven paragraph three where it says the term skills underutilisation is used to describe those people who would welcome the opportunity to work at a skills level which better matched their training qualifications or experience and I'm grateful to Marco Biagi for erm expanding in tha- a little bit more that's perhaps some of the research is more objective erm than I had picked up erm in the report itself erm but it does still seem to me strange that we erm measure employment and unemployment in very erm definite terms erm and it seems to be a little bit more vague and a little bit more subjective when we're talking about underemployment there is a cost too to the individual in the household but I think we mustn't forget too the cost to the wider economy and Margaret MacDougall   erm mentioned that in her speech if we're not using our national resources to best effect  erm so un- underemployment is not just erm some kind of extra that we would like to deal with but it is an absolutely a key economic challenge for the whole country but having mentioned voluntary underemployment erm for most people underemployment is not desirable and it is not voluntary and I thought Duncan McNeil  erm put that extremely well in his speech as he described the effect of some people of being in no hope kind of jobs one aspect of this this has been mentioned by several speakers is zero-hour contracts  and I think that does highlight the need to control employment law very often we have seen the European Union trying to improve employee's rights while reluctant Westminster governments have been dragged along kicking and screaming and I do think as part of that the Minimum Wage Legislation needs to be very strictly enforced erm because we do hear stories of people who are paid for one hour paid for another hour but the travelling time in between is not  paid in conclusion erm I was intrigued by Ken Macintosh's erm comment that Australians are happier than erm here and I think there is a serious point to that erm I lived in Nepal for three years and I would say that people there were happier than here as well and yet that was a very very poor country so going back to Duncan McNeil's point it is not just about money although money is very very key  but it's also things like job satisfaction and hope erm in the future and where people are going but finally the other sth- thought that strikes me about Australia is that they did leave the British Empire and they have never asked to come back is it me thank you Presiding Officer firstly I would like to congratulate the Economy Energy and Tourism Committee on their comprehensive report into the scale and effects of underemployment in Scotland I am keen to contribute  to discussions on this growing economic problem and to highlight the effects of underemployment on women and young people in particular underemployment is a deeply concerning social problem that has the ability to mask the poverty faced by families across Scotland that lurks behind u- unemployment figures that fails to reflect the reality of individuals facing financial hardship I was grateful to read the submission made to the Economy Energy and Tourism Committee by Professor David Bell of the University of Stirling I would like to thank him and his colleagues for their continued research  into the social econic- economic consequence of chronic underemployment in Scotland Presiding Officer I accept that for most people part-time work  is better than no work whatsoever however in Scotland
 there are now thousands of people who are looking for no more than a full-time position within the company that they currently work for  or simply for a job that adequately reflects their training experience and ability  it has been suggested that the answer to the problem of underemployment  is more training training may indeed be the answer for some young people who aspire to work in specific professions and sectors it is often a natural solution to a problem that seems to disappro- disproportionately  impact upon those who have recently completed a course of full-time education however I do not believe that the negative effects of underemployment  can be dealt with simply by upskilling workers to enable them to compete for higher level positions and we've heard underemployment  is not only about seeking more hours it is also about working in a role for which you are overqualified it's the graduate returning to the-  the job that they did before attending university just to make ends meet it's the college leaver doing three part-time jobs while they look for a fourth it's about accepting a zero-hour contract despite the fact it offers you no security guaranteed income or longer-term benefits this is not to say however that greater flexibility in working is not welcome part-time contracts can and in particular circumstances offer some individuals a way of accommodating family and other commitments alongside their working life however choosing to seek a part-time job is not the same as being compelled to take one in order to secure some work however infrequent  that is why I am joining my erm and that is why I am joining my Scottish Labour colleagues in calling on the Scottish government to ensure that the upc- coming procurement reform bill guards against the damaging use of zero-hour contracts by companies bidding for public sector contracts I am also concerned by recent statistics regarding the profile of those experience und- experiencing underemployment alongside young people women are disproportionately affected if we are to continue to break  the barriers of gender inequality that we face across the country then underemployment must be addressed I am pleased that the committee believes that improved childcare provision is important in tackling this and would also urge them to consider deeper analysis of the causes of gender imbalance and those suffering from underempl-   underemployment the ongoing economic challenges we face in Scotland has had deep and damaging consequences for families across the country we must work to ensure that surface improvements do not mask those who are struggling to make ends meet underemployment is a symptom of an economy that is failing to meet the needs of ordinary people I urge the Scottish government to do all it can to address the damaging effects of these employment practices and to end the exploitation of workers on low incomes by large corporations  for financial gain erm thank you very much erm Presiding Officer I'm erm not a member of the Economy Energy and Tourism Committee erm and so it's erm my delight to say words that are so seldom heard erm in this parliament  congratulations to Murdo Fraser  erm and of course the other members of his erm committee for erm what is a very interesting and engaging erm report erm i- it's a report that's going to give us more questions than answers and I think at this stage erm of looking at this subject that's not too surprising  erm today erm in my last day as the Deputy Convenor of the Subordinate Legislation Committee indeed it's the last day of the  Subordinate Legislation Committee but we rise phoenix-like tomorrow erm as the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee and I am suitably translated into my new erm position as the Deputy Convenor of that so now John Mason knows at least  erm what ex-ministers  erm are equipped to do since I make no claim to be underemployed or underskilled for the job  erm that I have I think the the committee sort of gives the game away of the complexity  erm of the subject that's before us in parliament today erm  in erm that it spends an entire A four page discussing what is underemployment and I think in honesty a good shot but probably the committee would agree that we we probably haven't nailed it down absolutely firmly because it isn't erm absolutely clear erm what underemployment  erm would be we basically rely on statistics where we ask individuals their view of their own situation and different people will view it  in different ways erm first job I had when I left school before I went to university as a nurse in nineteen sixty four erm I worked a hundred-and-eight-hour fortnight so almost anything after that erm is going to look like  underemployment if I applied the test of my hundred-and-eight-hour fortnight twelve days on two days off in nineteen sixty four so I think there are imprecisions likely to be in the statistics now having said that I think it's probably relatively clear that there is significant underemployment erm Kezia Dugdale sort of gave the game away by suggesting that it was significant in two thousand and eight yes in the UK probably two million people erm were underemployed but of course that has nothing to do with the fact that Labour had been in power for eleven years well she might actually be right because of course the stats don't go far enough back to to justify a robust erm conclusion but the numbers are going up and therefore it's correct that we should erm be looking erm at erm at erm what what that is now the committee has asked the Scottish government erm to improve the quality of statistics  to look at how labour market stats could be adapted to take account of developing trends and in particular erm perhaps erm underemployment now I think that's equally applicable erm to the UK government erm the Office of National Statistics serves both governments and therefore erm perhaps they should be asked erm to do some work to think about how better we can understand what is the nature of and the quantum erm of underemployment we do know that employment erm is rising erm we're now up to erm for sixteen to sixty-four-year-olds that excludes therefore me erm up to seventy one point erm eight percent and indeed Mister Brodie who is chuckling in the the margins as well erm but erm nonetheless erm whenever people want to work and cannot work that is an issue we properly engage with and I think many have referred to the fact that females are disproportionally affected and I think that too erm is important for us erm to consider the trends are probably reasonably erm informative but even they are not robust Laurence Pomeroy who was the chief engineer of Vauxhall Motors in the nineteen thirties said if you have to measure an improvement  you probably haven't made one well I don't think we should get too fixated about our inability to measure underemployment because it's probably sufficiently significant we can see it without having the confidence to say  it's this number  rather than that number erm so I think erm that that it it's  it's big enough erm although erm I think it was Deming who said if you can't measure it you can't improve it so certainly as we respond to the challenge of this we've got to have better numbers in front of us erm Professor Fred P Brooks who wrote a book called the Mythical Man Month erm posed the question how does a project get late and the answer is one day at a time well unemployment and underemployment is very similar it happens in little slices and eventually you realise the whole sausage erm has erm disappeared so therefore erm the difficulties of measurement erm should not erm prevent us erm from considering this to be a real problem now skills use now that's a real corker erm of a question because of course I don't necessarily want to use any erm all of the manifest skills that I built up over my long life and indeed anyone of my age may have done I make no exclusive claims  in that regard erm although I do acknowledge the plaudits from others in the chamber but the bottom line is we all gain huge amounts of experience that we go through life  and we're very unlikely ever to have a job that can use every skill erm that we may have but on the other hand if there are skills that are of economic value that we ought to be able to deploy in the workplace and we're unable to find employment  that helps us do that then certainly that is an issue erm which public policy erm should respond to Ken Macintosh erm  erm said a lot that I erm agreed with erm but erm in relation to the balance between  the benefit system and
 employment erm I would say to him in particular and I suspect he would agree with me on this that rather than following the UK government's current strategy which is to try make unemployment less attractive we need a strategy that makes employment  more rewarding erm and that's probably   erm something for which there'll be a consensus in ? I will erm the- thank you Presiding Officer the member makes erm a very good point one of the arguments always for Child Benefit was that that was something that went straight to the mother and therefore gave at least a modest  erm bit of security erm to the mother and I think I think the tax credit system  erm there are are some difficulties  erm with erm with that as well erm I just erm close by talking a little bit about erm  zero-hour contracts one of the difficulties is I'm not sure it's a contract because a contract has an offer an acceptance and something that's of  value that's delivered and I'm not sure that the latter part is met  and I suspect it probably at some point it'll be erm legally challenged erm I also think we need to be careful about imagining that skills will always find a home it's not always gonna be the case we mustn't get locked into the idea that we have to preserve all the skills erm that we've once had  we simply won't erm succeed in that and finally Presiding Officer taxation and here's a little suggestion for Westminster erm directors of companies get no bonuses if they are more than five percent to the profits to the company they work for the trick is  if there are no profits there are no bonuses maybe there'll be profits in the UK  then we can tax them and collect some of the tax but there's a little thought incomplete not fully thought out Presiding Officer will the member take me on that point erm erm I I I I thank Mister Stevenson for giving way I likewise I don't sit on the committee that produced this report but as a  former erm Deputy Chair of the Subordinate Legislation Committee Mister Stevenson I feel your pain in in relation to those meetings but as in terms of incentivising people into employment  erm erm I've not heard anyone mention yet reforms to the tax credit system and and now as some erm words made about gender inequalities in terms of underemployment do you think that reforms to  the tax credit system in particular has disadvantaged a lot of  female workers who are working part-time  and would like to do more hours and that  that is something the UK government works to ? at at Westminster  level that they should consider of course  in view of it not being with this Parliament at present I thank you Presiding Officer for this time and I come to this to be as someone who doesn't know who she's gonna be when she grows up I'm hoping I'm gonna find out quite soon erm but we mustn't we mustn't imagine that this idea of under- underemployment is a a new thing attributable to either Mrs Thatcher or or Tony Blair I was first elected forty years ago  in Govan and Govan was deindustrialising then that was the big problem and and much of that problem was that people were  underemployed or unemployed mainly underemployed at that stage then twenty years ago Lev- Ravenscraig shut signalling the end of the Scottish steel industry there was underemployment and unemployment and mismatched employment in Motherwell and Lanarkshire at that time this is a problem we've had with us in Scotland for a very long time I would suggest since we lost  the integration of much of of Scotland's heavy industry   because it used to be an integrated steel industry for example  all the skills were needed and used but then when the sk- the steel industry was nationalised it was it it was rationalisation it was called that followed it and that meant that the the good jobs all went south of the border and research and development went south of the border so there was underemployment and there was people doing work in Scotland who could have been doing much more and would have  when it was an integrated  industry in Scotland so don't let's kid ourselves that it's anything new it's just that we've managed to get by and so we haven't paid it the attention that we should have and now it is having an effect on our society and the quality of our our our behaviour towards each other  and an effect on the quality of the services that we can afford to provide when looking at it much more seriously but having said all that I'm with Duncan McNeil completely understand where he's coming from if you've get no job at all you'll take any job you'll sell off catalogues round the doors you'll do anything my mother did it when she was with a- and she was a- she was a nurse and she sold stuff round the doors and that was a dreadful job and in those days there was a lot more tenements than there are now and she was up and down tenements with her big  heavy case  dreadful work and dreadful money at the end of the the week and not sure how much money was going to come in so how could she plan for anything and erm lots of people look work like that but having said that I'm still with Duncan any job is worth  is more than no job  because no job eats into the soul Duncan wants an end to the contracts that are paying w- workers who work in this building rubbish money so do I but just supposing we'll manage to put two or three firms out of work we will put out of work and into unemployment other people so the thing is when we talk to a complexity  it's that simple unless we get it right we create more unemployment so what does Duncan and the others who pinpointed the the problems what do they want John Swinney to do about it what does he cut from his budget to make sure that these workers are not paying not paid rubbish wages or that we'd we underpay people providing services that is the question that has to be answered and everyone in here knows it unfortunately we've got this event happening next year that is dividing us because we don't need to be divided in this we all know there's two solutions either we have a socialist Britain or an independent Scotland
