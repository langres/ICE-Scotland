the final item of business today is a member's business debate on motion number six five five one in the name of James Kelly on Parkinson's nurses in Scotland providing effective safe person-centered care this debate will be concluded without any question being put those members who wish to speak in the debate please press the request to speak buttons now and I call on James Kelly to open the debate seven minutes please many thanks we now turn to the open debates speeches of four minutes and I call Margo MacDonald to be followed by Stewart Stevenson thank you very much I now call Stewart Stevenson  to be followed by Malcolm Chisholm erm like that so there are many many different ways thank you Malcolm Chisholm to be followed by Dennis Robertson Margo MacDonald Malcolm Chisholm and I can reimburse your time thank you very much thank you Deputy Presiding Officer and can I welcome the opportunity to open this evening's members' debate can I thank the members from across the parliament who have signed the motion and enabled me to bring it to the chamber of this evening and I can I also welcome the many campaigners from Parkinson's groups erm across the country who have made it to parliament for the lobby and also the debate this evening erm I think as the political parties gear up for the Aberdeen Donside by-election in two days' time they can perhaps learn a trick or two from the Parkinson's campaigners who have been very effective in making their views known and also at lobbying many of the MSPs this afternoon erm face-to-face erm there's no doubt erm erm and I'm sure MSPs experienced this in speaking to the campaigners that you know when you examine the impact of Parkinson's it it has erm on constituents and constituents' families that it has a quite a significant impact erm on people's lives and therefore it is important erm as parliamentarians that we take such an issue very seriously it's important to take on board that there are over ten thousand erm of those throughout Scotland who suffer from Parkinson's it affects one erm in five hundred and I'm very conscious  that in Rutherglen Cambuslang and Blantyre that that that number is the best part of two hundred which is actually higher than the average across the country erm and I'm very very aware of it in my constituency it was first brought to my attention erm by my constituent Harry Hay who's in the the gallery this evening erm and Harry pressed this case erm very articulately and very strongly and since then I have been erm very vocal in my own area for increased resources to support those who have Parkinson's and I think from that point of view the publication from erm Parkinson's UK of the recent report you know highlights erm many of that these issues and it comes on the back of the NHS Scotland report erm examining neurological issues because on that report the two key indicators that relate erm to Parkinson's erm on ongoing management on sorry on access erm to Parkinson's specialist services that criteria is not met by five of the health boards an on-going management of Parkinson's services is not met by ten of the health boards so there clearly a big job to be done across health boards in Scotland and I also very aware when I think back to the the last debate that erm I brought to this chamber in two thousand and eight on the importance of those with Parkinson's getting their medication on time that when I speak to to those involved that that issue still needs to be erm adressed in the NHS but I think the central issue erm that those in the gallery will argue for is the importance of Parkinson's nurse specialists and I think when you examine those are only in figures provided with SPICe there are only twenty nurse specialists throughout Scotland covering ten thousand people then you know that resource erm is not adequate the the recent report draws attention to the NICE recommendation that caseloads for nurse specialists should be a maximum of three hundred and where the stats show that they're running but erm at least five hundred I know that that is the case erm in NHS Lanarkshire which unfortunately does not meet the cri- erm the the criteria in the NHS Scotland report in relation to Parkinson and has erm a thousand people erm w- with Parkinson on its caseload but only two specialist nurses and it is quite clear that more priority needs to be given to it not just in NHS Lanarkshire but erm throughout the country I think erm there there are other issues that could also be addressed by health boards and highlighted in the UK Parkinson's report I think the importance of telemedicine telemedicine and also virtual teams particularly in rural areas can do a lot erm to support those with Parkinson's and crucially the link between GPs and the specialist nurses erm really has to be reinforced because I think if if the GPs have a a proper awareness they're able to you know detect the condition earlier and you know flag up appropriate treatment and that can help in the management of the condition I think another area that needs to be examined that is often overlooked is that of data collection because I think it's important that we you know collect appropriate data on the condition which can then help in terms of erm identifying best practice erm for the the management of it I think all these things together it's important to emphasise if they're properly managed we'd actually save money erm because if erm if we can better treat those with Parkinson's if we can keep them erm in in their homes as opposed to erm NH NHS hospitals that not on- not only saves the board's money but it it takes some of the stress erm away from families in terms of the the government's role erm you know clearly the priority's got to be on the NHS but I think the government you know needs to have a an important role in terms of leadership and coordination the recently allocated four million pounds erm for treatment of those with longterm conditions and p- part of that is for policy development erm and I think that is welcome and that is an important area but it is clear that some of the issues that are outlined in the report show that we need more policy development so that the NHS boards are more aware of these issues and they give it erm a greater priority I think it's also worth mentioning in the a- in the the advent of erm last week's po- coverage about NHS erm continuing care and the mistreatment of some of the cases that some of those can involve those erm with Parkinson's and I think it's important to have a proper process erm to examine erm where people have been mistreated and are due erm reimburse- reimbursement so these are erm big issues which affect erm many erm constituents erm and constituencies in in regions across the country I think it's as important to speak up and speak out on the issues there's an absolute key role erm for NHS boards I think it's important that we use this debate we use the message from the campaigners to get the get it across to the boards that they must take the the issue more seriously and we want urgent and practical action thank you for your support four minutes thank you very much indeed Deputy Presiding Officer feel as though I've wandered into a meeting of AA I'm Margo and I've got Parkinson's however you'll excuse me if I don't shake all over the place because it just so happens that that is under control so I should be able to comment on one or two things I have never tried to make myself an example erm to people who have Parkinson's because every who has Parkinson's has a different form of it and it's no use saying they're so and so why aren't you like so and so because you're not like so and so and you can't be and why should you be that is something that rather appeals to me the independence of it but I think there is a greater general awareness required I think James would probably agree amongst the general public there's something of a erm an unknown territory associated with Parkinson's it's one of these things you don't want to get but you're not quite sure what you've got until you've got it certainly I wasn't I wasn't at all sure what it was until I was diagnosed and then I found out that it wasn't actually as bad as I thought it was and I certainly found out you just y- y- you went on with your life you had to make certain adaptations but don't you have to do that as you get a little older not that I'm d- meaning to get any older but if I get older I expect I'll have to adapt some things there's also more research needed I think into the whole business of Parkinson's and there's this absolutely wonderful research being done I know but I'd still like to see a bit more research done it seems that we have waited a very long time for breakthroughs in the condition but the erm really important thing that was highlighted by James there was the very simple thing the link between GPs patients and specialist erm nurses and in some areas it's because the GPs have not kept up with developments I regret to say that and I hope they take it as erm  me chiding them and immediately get to know all about it and get to know about the specialist nurses the specialist nurses are too few in number from the point of view of a Parkinson's sufferer but then there are so many competing claims for the priority choices made by a health board that I do understand it but it's where the people in the gallery come in it's the campaigners it's the people who are absolutely solidly always out in front saying erm we should have a greater priority than we have or something  has happened that makes urgent a a change the rules or the law or whatever it is so I pay full tribute to the campaigners for the condition because I think that in future they can expect to be doing even more because there will be even more competition for the resources and erm I wish I had longer because I would go and I would tell you all terrible sad things but I don't have longer thank you very much Presiding Officer thank you Presiding Officer it's when the member is on the subject of care and carers erm I probably wouldn't get my tea tonight if I didn't say what a wonderful carer I have at home but it's a serious point the three nurses in Lothian are worked off their feet they are very good nurses and there's a good communication system and so on but there will never I think be enough and that was the point I was trying to make so I would like to see training in caring being extended to the carers people who will not become professional carers but have some more additional knowledge given to them and that comes down through that route erm thank you very much erm Presiding Officer and let me erm start by congratulating James Kelly on giving us this erm opportunity erm to to have this erm debate tonight I've not signed the motion that's pure inadvertence erm and certainly not deliberate erm because I was in erm chamber this afternoon speaking in another debate I was unable to hear Harry Hay and the many other people who are in the gallery but I'm absolutely sure that they will have put their point across erm extremely well let me start by congratulating the Parkinson's nurses that there are across Scotland erm one of the things actually none of my predecessors in the debate made reference to which erm I'm sure is part of the erm service delivered is of course the service to the carers of those who suffer from Parkinson's because of course like many a long-term conditions it is unlikely to be one that you suffer alone erm it's one that is shared erm with many others erm around you in NHS Grampian the area erm the board that covers erm my constituency we're relatively fortunate in having erm four nurses erm James Kelly erm is highlighted in the briefing that the society has given us erm for his work erm with NHS Lan- erm Lanarkshire and I hope that he continues erm with that now of course we erm we meet erm Parkinson's in many sorts of different circumstances and of course it isn't a single condition and not all tremors are Parkinson's and not all Parkinson's suffer from a single disease I remember it being brought vividly home to me the effects of this disease on a nine-hour flight with a person sitting next to me erm I would s- suggest probably had Parkinson's and certainly had a tremor that continued for nine hours I didn't get to sleep but I thought to myself how lucky I was for erm having nine hours of very mild inconvenience whereas the person sitting beside me erm had a substantial erm difficulty that he would erm experience for a long time there are many erm causes of Parkinson's my father who was a GP always erm worried that my mother would develop it as a by-product of her having had diphtheria erm when she was a child erm many of the causes are not erm so obviously connected erm to something erm like that so there are many many different ways research is comparatively modest  and there is also because there doesn't appear to be very much prospect of financial benefit  to the pharmaceutical companies from addressing the issue of curing the disease or erm Parkinson-specific erm drugs  not as much research in this as there perhaps is in in other areas there are lots of drugs for treating the specific symptoms that vary from person to person but not a great deal erm that is spent erm on looking at erm erm bigger bolder interventions that might make a real difference erm to the people erm who are are are represented in the gallery erm today now I've always taken an interest in particular in mental ill health and of course any disease such as Parkinson's always comes with it in a significant proportion of cases erm with mental ill health because when people are struck by a disease out of the blue at the age of fifty sixty perhaps younger when you've still got the expectation of many years of productive life ahead it's not just a physical condition it can be a mental one so I hope and believe that the Parkinson's nurses will adress that as well  but also of course I come back to the issue of carers and I do hope that we'll hear in this erm short debate this evening that carers in an important part of the support that can be given to Parkinson's and I end by simply once again congratulating James Kelly  and Parkinson's nurses for the work that they have both done Presiding Officer erm Presiding Officer I'd like to congratulate James Kelly on introducing this very important erm message today and also welcome welcoming all the Parkinson campaigners who are in the gallery today and  erm some of whom I was very pleased to erm speak to an hour or so erm ago and I think it's very important for politicians as for   all health professionals to listen and learn from patients and I think erm the clearest message that came from the campaigners today was that Parkinson nurses are absolutely central erm to their care erm in a kind of way I wasn't surprised of that in general terms because in so many erm disease areas I've come across patients saying they the the clinical nurse specialist is the person that really  matters to me and the the latest example of that was of the cross-party group on cancer last week it was about brain tumors and with all the problems that they described they said the rock erm that they relied on was the clinical nurse specialists so that doesn't surprise me in general terms but clearly there are specific erm erm functions for the Parkinson erm clinical nurse specialists that we erm that I also heard about erm today so they've impressed upon me how important the issue of of access ready access to the nurse specialists when there were any issues or problems and in general they said that that the nurse would make sure that plenty of time was made available to discuss the issue which concerned them the specific as- issue I think they asked me to raise with the minister was erm the funding for the for the nurse specialists because we have to also pay tribute to Parkinson's UK who did put a lot of pump-prime funding I understand into new posts so I think the assurance that erm the campaigners and indeed MSPs would like today is that th- the Government will ensure health boards do  pick up erm the funding in due course I think that's the the nature of the arrangement that Parkinson's UK have come into with the various health boards so clearly it would be it would be good to know about future funding and that's related of course to the number because the NICE guidelines we're told suggest one for every three hundred erm patients with Parkinson's I know in Lothian there's three for seventeen hundred erm people with Parkinson's so that clearly suggests there could be a bit more but having said that the service erm in Lothian as elsewhere was highly praised by the people who spoke erm to me now I think we we we know in general terms the importance o- of clinical nurse specialists in terms of helping to join up care because people often talk of fragmented care but the nurse specialist can liaise with all the different health professionals and the social   care people who may be involved and help to join up care erm for erm the patient and they can also of course I give way to Margo MacDon- well I thank erm Margo MacDonald for making that erm important point and erm erm perhaps not unrelated to the other role erm one of many other roles that the clinical nurse specialists have is actually to train and educate other health professionals but it may be that that's part of their role in relation to erm carers erm as well so I certainly erm pay tribute to all of those nurses who are so highly valued by erm people with Parkinson's disease now of course the m- the motion in a sense encapsulates so much of important health policy and issues erm I congratulate James Kelly for formulate it and managing to put in issues such as patient-centered care erm self-management and of course helping to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions all great erm o- objectives of health policy for many years an- and not always successfully realised so they're important erm for that it also mentions the neurological standards I'm sure the minister will mention those in his wind-up they have been important in driving up erm standards erm of care so erm an- a- and we note a- erm as others will I'm sure that there are three of those standards about Parkinson's nurses how all boards should have them as key members of the multidisciplinary team so I'm glad that erm that that Lothian my own board erm does have that but clearly as Margo MacDonald has said there is always room erm for more and I hope it will be possible for the minister to give us some possig- positive messages about future funding for this vital important role
