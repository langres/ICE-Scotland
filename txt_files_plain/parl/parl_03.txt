thank you very much I now call Anne McTaggert to be followed by Annabel Goldie thank you I now call Annabel Goldie to be followed by Mary Fee thank you very much and finally Mary Fee thank you very much thank you Presiding Officer I'm delighted to contribute to this important debate on challenging negative racial and religious stereotypes and also erm to add my congratulations to Amina Muslim's Women Re- Resource Centre and welcome some of them to the chamber this evening and also to one of the directors Faten who's he- also here as well erm we're here tonight erm really to talk about the launch  of their  I speak for myself campaign and how successful that was but in doing doing that I'm aware I should mention and thank my colleague Hanzala Malik for securing the time and chamber erm to talk about the important issues that had arisen from this campaign and to highlight some of the excellent work  being carried out erm in the region of Glasgow Amina's I speak for myself campaign is just one of many examples of what is great about the third sector in Scotland Amina's Mu- Muslim Women's Resource Centre visited Scottish secondary schools to discuss Islam with  with pupils and they recognised a problem a staggering seventy percent of the pupils they spoke to with associated incre- associated incredibly false and negative ideas with Muslim women Amina identified this problem and immediately went about fixing it they campained to challenge misconceptions about Muslim women by actively getting out and speaking to Muslim women about their experiences their identity and their personal beliefs as one we can all be proud of Nil by Mouth is another e- excellent example of a charity that is working hard to challenge negative and religious stereotypes on a budget of only sixty thousand pounds Nil by Mouth delivered workshops to over five thousand people last year in my own region of Glasgow Nil by Mouth have been working with a- one of my local schools Garscadden primary school and Saint Brendan's primary school over the last few years their projects have allowed the pupils to learn more not just about their other faiths and cultures but also about their own the vast majority of pupils enter into such projects with great interest and enthusiasm I believe that this could be the generation which beats bigotry once and for all the work done by organisations such as Nil by Mouth and Amina and many others
 are incredibly important and must be adequately funded but they only work when they are matched with the education policy and far-reaching initiatives that get to the heart of the problem intolerance to engender real change in our communities integrated approaches are essential I trust that the Scottish government agree with me and will use  the cross-party support of these campaigns as a springboard to real overview of the incredible work being done by the charitable sector erm thank you Deputy Presiding Officer can I too thank and congratulate Hanzala Malik for bringing
 this motion before the Parliament for debate I know that before coming to this Parliament Hanzala Malik already played an important role as an advocate for the Muslim community as a Glasgow city councillor for seventeen years indeed it was my pleasure many years ago to encounter him  in that capacity when we were members of the court of the University of Strathclyde to which he made a  distinguished contribution and we brought our different backgrounds and our different experiences to that forum but in bringing this debate to the Parliament I think he has achieved  two important things firstly and quite rightly he highlights the imagination and the innovation of Amina wo- Muslim Women's Resources Centre in Glasgow in devising and launching the I speak for myself campaign
 which is deserving of praise in its own right and secondly the carefully drafted script of his motion lifts the veil on the vulnerability  the apprehension the isolation felt by many within the Muslim community all of which can be intensified by external events and as a parliament we should be very concerned if that community suffers from misconceptions about and endures discrimination towards Muslim women and the Islamic faith that is utterly unacceptable and it is important that this parliament both as an institution and through its proceedings and debates condemns such activity and plays its part in educating dispelling the myths and promoting awareness of such issues to eliminate these negative attitudes in their own way I think Show Racism The Red Card and Nil by Mouth have been very effective ve- vehicles in maintaining awareness keeping these issues to the forefront of discussion and guarding against the enemy of complacency I noted with interest the suggestion in the motion of a more integrated and systematic approach to tackling problems of negative stereotypes  and discrimination there may indeed be scope for that but I think there is also strength in numbers and I would not like to see the identities of these two campaigns and this new one I speak for myself blurred I think all three have something very important to say broadening the debate out to consider what positive options are available to help in the work of these campaigns I can think of no better model Deputy Presiding Officer than the Annual Pakistan Welfare Trust Dinner like others in the chamber I have had the pleasure of attending this dinner over many years  it is a highlight in the calendar for the Muslim community but it has developed a very positive reputation with the many guests from politics and civic Scotland in my opinion it has played a very important role in broadening awareness and understanding and nurturing solid and positive relationships it is also an immensely enjoyable social occasion but this year I thought the dinner was outstanding it took place against the backdrop of the appalling murder of Lee Rigby in Woolwich to which Malcolm Chisholm referred but that tragedy served to demonstrate at the dinner how from our different backgrounds and from our different cultures we stand united in condemning what is wrong and is bad
 and also united in supporting what is good and what is right and that unity of purpose was explicit in the apposite reading from the Koran that evening and in the many speeches made at the dinner there was a power for good that evening tangible to all who were present born out of mutual respect and quite simply over the years born out of getting to know one another I hope these strengths will imbue and encourage both the existing campaigns and this new campaign I speak for myself and I wish it every success thank you Presiding Officer and can I start off by congratulating my friend and colleague Hanzala Malik for securing this member's debate on an issue that has an effect on many individuals within the black and ethnic minority community not only here in Scotland but across the globe it would be naive of any member to suggest that Scotland is a haven for racial equality and that the campaigns implemented by the current and the previous administrations has tackled stereotypes and negative attitudes towards race and religion as we all know there's still a long long way to go the debated motion pays specific reference to the campaign I speak for myself a very emotive campaign put forward in- to the public in a very simple way the campaign uses real people and real life examples to help show that Muslim women are just like any other member of society and that they drink Irn-Bru and are interested in their local football club
 campaigns such as this help bring about community cohesion and continue to show that Scotland is a welcoming and inclusive nation for anyone who wishes to come here every member within this chamber as well as individuals across  the UK and around the world
 are aware of the death of Drummer Lee Rigby and this has led to an increased presence by far right groups to paint a single religion as the perpetrators of this atrocity and these groups have used a single event caused by two individuals who just happened to be from a certain religion and then they've used it to help fuel tensions and reinforce negative attitudes and stereotypes leaders of various faith groups rightly stood side by side to declare that this was an attack by two people not an attack by a religion and this solidarity of support  is a beacon of hope and unity one which was recognised by the majority of the population across the UK this having been said there has unfortunately been an increase in the number of islamophobic  a- acc- incidents attacks and crimes of any kind are terrible but those that are motivated by malice or ill will towards a specific group in society due to someone's religion and beliefs are downright despicable I commend the work undertaken by various groups such as the Amina Women's Resource Centre their campaign I speak for myself has really enabled them to help raise awareness of discrimination and issues that the Muslim community are facing and I whole-heartedly support the idea of an integrated and systematic approach to tackling the issue of negative stereotypes and discrimination with more organisations collaborating together they will be able to reach various societal groups bringing their message to various parts of the country and in doing this they will help pave the way for a more equal respectful and tolerant Scotland and as Dennis Robertson has previously mentioned the Equal Opportunities Committee has completed two inquiries into Gypsy Travellers in the last year and a half and one of the key messages that stem from both reports is that Gypsy Travellers
 as an ethnic group are very often stereotyped and discriminated against often as a result of media coverage we find evidence of newspapers encouraging the nimby attitude to Gypsy Travellers and TV programmes portraying them in a bad manner leading to the promotion of stereotypical  Gypsy Travellers
 and finally Presiding Officer I just like to take the chance to sum up my feelings on the motion and debate by quoting former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan ignorance and prejudice are the handmaidens of propaganda our own mission therefore is to confront ignorance with knowledge bigotry with tolerance and isolation with the outstretched hand of generosity racism can will and must be defeated and with that Deputy Presiding Officer I gladly lend my support to this motion
