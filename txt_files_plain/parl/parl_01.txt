the final item of business today is a member's business debate on motion number five six one zero in the name of Christine Grahame on James the Fourth and Flodden Field this debate will be concluded without any questions being put with those members who wish to speak in the debate please press the request-to-speak buttons now or as soon as possible and if you are ready Miss Grahame if you like to give us seven minutes worth please thank you very much and now calling John Lamont to be followed by Sandra White many thanks I now call in Sandra White after which we move to Minister Lamont yes Sandra White and thank you and I now call in Minister erm Cabinet Secretary Fiona Hyslop to close the debate on behalf of the government please  thank you very much thank all those who've contributed and I now close this meeting of parliament I I feel my voice may echo around this chamber this afternoon can I first thank all members who signed the motion which has allowed this debate to proceed and indeed those who've relinquished a trip to somewhere in the North to be here this is a debate on a timely topic with the quincentennial anniversary of Flodden on ninth September this year a date in my diary as it also is my birthday not quincentennial though I sometimes feel it as and aside I think we're all taught history when we're too young or perhaps these days it's livelier and given the immediacy of real life and relevancy to our own lives James the Fourth though our king was first and foremost a man flesh and blood who breed loved and died like all of us a real person he was also a political beast as monarchs were then and some would say even now with a small p he was astute making alliances educated surviving and dying in in violent circumstances this will be therefore if you'll forgive me a bit of a pottied and selective history born fourteen seventy three at the age of fifteen he rode at the Battle of Sauchieburn where his father was killed it is said he wore an iron belt as penance from that date to his death on Flodden Field in fifteen thirteen he was forty life then even for monarchs with the exception perhaps of Elizabeth Tudor was short but in that time he achieved much he spoke Latin at that time the international language French German Flemish Italian Spanish and some Gaelic and took an active interest in literature science and the law even trying his hand at dentistry and minor surgery with his patronage the printing press came to Scotland and the Royal College of Surgeons at Edinburgh Saint Leonard's College Saint Andrews' and King's College Aberdeen were founded he commissioned building work at the royal residences of Linlithgow Palace Edinburgh Castle and Stirling Castle developed a strong navy led by his flagship the Great Michael said to be the largest vessel of its time but he is remembered most because of the massacre at Flodden even to this day there is a ? moment in the Selkirk Common Riding the Casting of the Colours in the square testifying each year to the fact that of eighty Selkirk men who left to fight at Flodden only one returned Fletcher
 the Casting of the Colours replicates the legend that he cast a captured English flag about his head to show that all the others had been cut down to this day the Casting of those Colours to the rhythmic drumbeat silences the crowd Flodden itself which I first saw on a breezy bright July day is not an historic monument but a war memorial an important distinction on that July day the long grasses in the fields below where the slaughter took place ripple like green water and on the memorial someone had laid a clutch of thistles at  that moment for me the pain of that day the waste of lives although centuries past was quite tangible it is said that between a thousand and four thousand  English soldiers were casualties and that between seven thousand and eleven thousand Scots also lay dead including King James and most of his nobles on that field such was the concern that the English would march on to Edinburgh that the construction of the Flodden Wall was begun you can see a bit of it just up the road if you turn left at the lights to the Pleasance
 James' burial place is unkown but it is alleged that three artefacts a sword a dagger and turquoise ring belonging to him were taken from that battlefield these are currently held in the custody of Mister Cheeseman who I correspond with  Richmond Herald College of Arms London and although their provenance is not secure there is sufficient at least I think for the sword to have been the sword of James the Fourth I am grateful to Gary Stewart of the Society of William Wallace together with Doctor Elspeth King of the Smith Art Gallery and Museum in Stirling and indeed parliament staff here who are negotiating the terms of loan of those artefacts to Scotland for possible display both here  and at the museum in the weeks at the end of August to October and I'm hoping in the week of Flodden to be exhibited here in the public area fingers crossed but James has another claim to fame he also married with consequences unforeseen at the time Margaret Tudor one of Henry the Seventh of England's daughters was called the Rough Wooing a marriage of the Thistle and the Rose which took place at Holyrood on eighth August fifteen oh three this match had great significance in the long term it was after the death of Elizabeth the First of England and the end of the Tudor dynasty the two thrones were inherited by James' and Margaret' s great-grandson James the First of England and the Sixth of Scotland the Stewarts had arrived the rest as they say is history quite literally it now seems inevitable that the marriage of the Thistle and the Rose the union of the crowns would move onward to the union of the parliaments the threads from that history of five hundred years ago what gave us the Union Flag with devolution  some of that stitching was unpicked next year will tell us whether those threads remain or will finally be cut and the Saltire will fly on its own again whatever happens it will be from that other Holyrood that event takes place thank you Presiding Officer erm erm can I begin my contribution this afternoon by congratulating Christine Grahame for securing erm this afternoon's erm debate on this im- -portant topic and it's my erm great pleasure to be able to add my erm modest contribution to today's erm discussion can I also just record erm my thanks to erm Greg Lamont who has helped to s- research the speech erm today and he finishes working in the Scottish Parliament erm erm this week and I'm very grateful for the help he's given in preparing this not many occasions are remembered five hundred years erm after they occur and I  doubt very much my contribution today will be but the fact that the Battle of Flodden is remembered half a millenium later illustrates its its importance as a central part of Scotland's historical journey and its national story the Battle of Flodden will be remembered once again this year all over my  Borders constituency during many of the Borders towns, Common Ridings and Civic Weeks and my hometown of Coldstream is no exception with the annual ride out to Flodden seen as the zenith of the annual Civic Week it was fifty one years ago that the first cavalcade of horses made its way to Flodden with over one hundred horses and riders been piped over Coldstream Bridge to ? against the background waters of the river Tweed whilst five hundred years ago we crossed the border to meet our foes making the journey as outlaws today we cross it as friends as neighbours indeed as family and whilst five hundred years ago we Scots rode over the border to raid today we do so to remember an ancient rivalry perhaps those on both sides who fell and to celebrate the central importance of the Battle of Flodden in our Scottish story Deputy Presiding Officer James the Fourth's defeat at Flodden erm gives him the unique claim of being the last monarch of in Scotland England or Wales to die in battle however whilst those are certainly the main facets of James the Fourth's memory which have been immortalised by history they are far from his only achievements if that is the right word to use his accomplishments range far beyond his ability to lose decisive battles he was an experienced horseman and in spite what I've already said a talented military leader but he was far from a warmongering brute he was a steadfast patron of the arts and his drive to improve cultural political and scientific developments in Scotland earned him the honorary and rather becoming title of the Renaissance Prince as Christine Grahame has already noted five hundred and five years ago erm erm he issued erm the first sorry in her motion Christine Grahame notes that he issued the first royal license for printing in Scotland with the first printed book in Scotland being published erm one year later in fifteen oh eight on a printing press not far from here in the Cowgate a copy of that manuscript  remains to this day in the National Library of Scotland and stands as a testament to James the Fourth's contribution to literature learning and enlightenment in Scotland not only that but in the Palace of Ho-  Holyrood House it stands just a few hundred feet of where we debate this afternoon was its existence and its current location to the vision of James the Fourth however Deputy Presiding Officer it's not only Scotland's culture and landscape that was influenced by James the Fourth its very shape as a nation was transformed as a result of his life his marg- marriage to Margaret Tudor Tudor and the eventual unification of the Scots and English royal households that resulted strengthened re- erm relations between Scotland and England at the time the poet William Dunbar hailed it as the end to the Anglo-Scottish ri- rivalry that had raged for centuries past the influence of this and the eventual Act of Union in seventeen oh seven is hardly insignificant as such James the Fourth's legacy remains very pertinent to us today Christine Grahame may not have forgiven James the Fourth for the consequences of his choice of companion but that debate Deputy Presiding Officer is for another day thank you just for the sake of  clarification erm Selkirk is actually in my own constituency erm the neighbouring constituency is erm represented by Christine Grahame erm thank you very much Presiding Officer and if I can just apologise just now and I sent a note to Presiding Officer I can't wait for the summing up speech I'm sorry erm Cabinet Secretary I do have another meeting to to go to erm can I congratulate erm Christine Grahame in securing today's debate  on a subject which I think we all know is very close to her heart and it was very fitting that last weekend the loss of life at the Battle of Flodden five hundred years ago was the focus for one of Europe's oldest and biggest equestrian spectacles the Selkirk Ridings in my  colleague's constituency now I'm not sure if my colleague took part riding through the town on that day perhaps erm a modern day Lady God- Godiva oh I have lost yes I I thank I thank the member for that correction but it  certainly wouldn't stop my erm friends and erm fe- fellow member from attending anyway I certainly heard from I was just wondering if she did attend in a position perhaps erm Lady Godiva I'm sure she can let us let us know that in that respect erm I also want to thank Gary Stewart and Elspeth King erm for the work they've done in this particular issue but erm the work they have done in previous issues also erm they do so much to ensure that our history here in Scotland is kept very much alive erm as we've heard from previous contributors the Common Ridings was established to remember the four hundredth anniversary of that fateful day in fifteen thirteen when eighty men were left to fight for King James the Fourth and just one returned and as legend has it he returned with a captured English standard around his head and lowering its tip to the ground he let the people of Selkirk know that everyone else had perished with a generation of borderers lost in a battle immortalised in a Scots folk song The Flowers of the Forest The Flowers of the Forest are a'wede Away and I wouldn't sing it a haunting tune which many know as a lament played on Rememberance Day or Rememberance Sunday the song goes on to tell the fate of the battle the English for ance by guile won the day for it says that although King James the Fourth's army vastly outnumbered his English rivals through Scottish mistakes and English guile they inflicted one of the heaviest defeats against the Scots in our history King James was killed and his body removed taken to bury embalmed and put in a lead coffin the coffin was taken to London and placed in a monastery but disappeared
 during the dissolution of the monasteries about twenty years later mystery still surrounds the whereabouts of the body but some rumours suggest that he was eventually buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral and it would be interesting to know if this indeed was the case maybe something my colleague could take up along with the many ? crusade and she's already mentioned such in   her erm opening speech I also ? my colleague in her call for this motion says the artefacts attributed to him a sword dagger and turquoise ring currently with the College of Arms in London to repun- return to Scotland in time for the anniversary indeed only the other month more artefacts of the battle were unearthed under the field where the battle was fought a badge made of cor- copper alloy that appears to have been snapped off a hat band  its design includes the fleur-de-lis with jewels and diamonds elements which were part of the Scottish crown in fifteen thirteen it shows that there's still much to be discovered about this battle and Scotland's history and I'm always surprised and was particularly interested to hear that James the Fourth was fluent in many languages Latin French German Flemish Italian and Spanish you know if only we had such language skills you know today perhaps we'll move on to that now all these skills reflected the vital importance that Scotland played in Europe at the time and enduring friendships were built up throughout the continent  it is a shame that events that followed erm would seem to have reduced this erm erm friendship and and that was built up throughout the years but I'm sure as history has moved on we see this friendship rebuilding particularly with the European
 erm friends and I'm sure this history will not repeat itself that we will go on to independence and the referendum in twenty fourteen and all of this is being built up with friendships and languages will continue to flourish in an independent Scotland thank you very much want to erm congratulate Chr- Christine Grahame for securing this members debate and for her continuing efforts to mount an exhibition here in parliament about the Flodden ob- objects from the College of Arms in London and I think what we may not have had in terms of quantity in terms of speeches I certainly think we have made up in terms of quality from the three speeches that we've heard today erm fi- very fine speeches one of Scotland's greatest kings erm erm Christine Grahame has as set out that James the the Fourth had quite quite remarkable achievements in his life re- I think he's she's quite right to to set these out but of course James the Fourth's reign ended in desaster it had all started so well erm just eleven years earlier the Treaty of Perpetual Peace had been signed between Scotland and England and the following year on the eighth of August fifteen oh three James married his child-bride Margaret Tudor across the road from here in Holyrood Abbey and the Thistle and the Rose were finally at peace and yet the dreich autumnal day in fifteen thirteen thousands of the flower of Scotland were sized down the immediate impact of the Battle of Flodden was horrendous the Head of State the king was dead along with much of the country's governing elite the army was decimated with thousands of foot soldiers slaughtered it's hard to imagine but the nation was rocked to its core and Sir David Lindsay the Scot's poet in parlamentarian writing in fifteen thirty reflected I never read in tragedy nor story at one journey so many nobles slain for the defence and love of their sovereign and then there was the human impact hardly a family in the land was left unaffected by the battle's aftermath not even the royal family Queen Margaret with her seventeen month old son was waiting in Linlithgow Palace for news of her husband it took five days to come to protect her son she immediately went to Stirling Castle where twelve days after his father's death the child was crowned King James the Fifth five hundred years on this isn't just forgotten history these are real events with real and lasting consequences on Scotland's future both then and now throughout this centenniary year there has been a resurgence of interest in a wide range of events that are taking place on both sides of the border to commemorate the Battle of Flodden many are community inspired initiatives brought together under the Remembering Flodden Project the old red telephone box in Branxton near the battlefield has been turned into the world's smallest visitor centre and tours of the battlefield will mark the anniversary on the ninth of September the Flodden Five Hundred Archaeology Project has brought professional archaeologists and local community enthusiasts together to better understand the battlefield site and the Flodden Fifteen Thr- Thirteen Ecomuseum  is working with Historic Scotland and other partners to create weblinks with many associated historical sites and as part of its fourtieth birthday celebrations the Scottish Chamber Orchestra has commissioned three new pieces one of which was composed by Sally Beamish specifically to commemorate the battle during an evening focused on more music aptly entitled The Pity of War the piece will premier during the orchestra's twenty thirteen season at venues throughout Scotland from this October through to May next year the same tragic loss of life was marked in a very different manner as we've heard in the Borders just last week  when the Common Riding in Selkirk also remembered  the time in fifteen thirteen when eighty
 of the townsmen left to fight for King James and only one returned and throughout this summer
 Historic Scotland's living history events will be remembering Flodden
 the popular annual jousting event at Linlithgow Palace will recall this year that the knights jousting in  the summer of fifteen thirteen were those who lost their lives a few weeks later at Flodden at Edinburgh Castle the story of the optimistic prelude to the battle will be told the army mustering and the medals and the state-of-the-art artillery being brought out from the castle's gunhouse the programme will culminate in a week- weekend long event on the twenty first to twenty second of September at Stirling Castle relating the defeated armies return and the crowning  of the infant King James the Fifth also Iona Leishman the former artist in residence will be exhibiting new paintings in the Chapel Royal inspired by the events around the battle destruction is in the nature of war and few artefacts survive intact from Flodden mystery and family tradition surround those that do the Keith Heraldic Standard was gifted to the Faculty of Advocates here in Edinburgh in eighteen oh eight by a descendant of Black John Skirving the Earl Standard Bearer and the story goes that Black John survived the battle but was taken prisoner he saved the banner by stuffing it inside his clothes although doubts have been cast recently on the authenticity of the College of Arms a- objects and similar uncertainty must be attached to the Keith Standard the stories that surround them are marvellous and very much part of the traditions associated with the battle and I commend Christine Grahame for her successful efforts to secure the loan of the Flodden objects from the College of Arms in London many things now lost were no doubt taken from the battllefield in the days that followed not least the mutilated corpse of the king it was not treated well taken to Sheen Monastery in Surrey the deca- capitated body now lies buried somewhere in the ruins under a modern golf course and the head buried un- unceremoniously in Saint Michael's Church in London is now under an office block under unlike erm Richard the Third the last English king to die in battle whose remains were discovered recently in a Leicester carpark there seems little likelihood that the remains of the last king of Scots to die in battle  will ever return home the Flodden commemorations demonstrate what can be achieved by reuniting a erm behind a common purpose starting next year preparations are well under way across the country to commemorate the first centenary of the First World War another conflict in which the Flower of Scotland paid a heavy price here again I see meaningful and imaginative collaborations being developed across the entire cultural sector these and this year's Flodden-related events show the huge passion and committment so many have for a historic environment in its widest and fullest sense and I thank Christine Grahame for bringing the motion today so we can debate what is impart-  -portant part of Scotland's history and the telling of Scotland's tale
