and I call on Mary Scanlon seven minutes please Rhoda Grant you might wish to draw to a close now please thanks and I now call on Rhoda Grant erm seven minutes please Margo MacDonald Rhoda Grant Bob Doris Rhoda Grant many many thanks and I now call on Angela Constance Minister you have up to ten minutes please many many thanks and I now call on Dennis Robertson to wind up on behalf of the Economy Energy and Tourism Committee Mister Robertson you have until five o'clock which is exactly nine and a half minutes please John Mason Dennis Robertson two minutes Mister Robertson Margo MacDonald one minute Mister Robertson well done and we now move on to the next item of business erm as that  concludes the debate on underemployment in Scotland and the next item of business is decision time and there is one question to be put as a result of today's business and the question is that motion six seven eight two in the name of Murdo Fraser on underemployment in Scotland be agreed to are we all agreed we are and that concludes decision time and we'll now move on to members' business and I'd ask members who are leaving the chamber to do so quietly please thank you Presiding Officer I'd first of all like to commend Duncan McNeil and Margo MacDonald because I think they not only brought reality to this topic erm but also an understanding and empathy erm to the whole debate erm I do commend the Energy Enterprise and Tourism Committee on their erm sixth report in this session on underemployment in Scotland erm but I do wonder if Chic Brodie and Mike MacKenzie ever turned up for the committee maybe they went to another committee  erm because over three months erm they actually signed up for the report and I went through every single page there's not one note of dissent erm and yet they spent the whole speech erm speaking about anything except the report and disagreeing with everything that Murdo Fraser John Swinney and so many others had said erm but there we are erm  I have to say that there are parts of the report that I had erm a little bit of difficulty with erm paragraph sixty two notes committee's concerns that there is a risk that some of the trends that have emerged during the economic downturn  may become embedded in a way that makes work more insecure particularly for the young and unskilled and these risks are rightly involuntary part-time work zero-hours contract which many speakers have erm mentioned and temporary contracts but that was alongside self-employment and I'm not quite sure why self-employment is regarded as a risky trend erm because surely this should be encouraged erm in a country of budding entrepreneurs and my second point is probably the definition of underemployment certainly not oh certainly not I don't think you're in the same debate as I I'm not sure you should even be here of what I'm discussing has got absolutely no no relation to your contribution today you've had enough you've had your chance my second point is the definition of underemployment and I think that there is a caution here about generalising everyone into one category because over the years I've known many people including myself who would be regarded as underemployed erm given that they're in jobs well below their level of competence experience and qualification but at that time the job suited them and I think about the high influx of Polish and Eastern European migrants to the Highlands many professionally qualified people chose to work in hospitality or the retail sector in order to practise their language skills they didn't feel confident erm in working in their own profession many people undertake further study work in jobs that suit them at the time and many people after a long absence from work due to physical or mental illness quite often take jobs with a level of responsibility that suits them at that time so we should not assume that all those who would be designated as underemployed need our intervention to come in and sort them out it's also a case that many people are content in the jobs that they do many people don't want to be managers they don't want to be team leaders and I think we should respect this view and thirdly and the debate today has reminded me of this very much underemployment reminds me of the Peter Principle which in this context could be classified as overemployment my personal view is that although there is no monetary loss to the individual in fact the opposite is true this is equally bad for business and bad for public service the Peter Principle is when people are promoted well above their level of competence to jobs with duties they cannot fulfil work is accomplished in this organisational hierarchy by those who have not reached their level of incompetence I'm sure Presiding Officer we've all met them erm no names no pack drill as they say erm and then there is underemployment in terms of working hours and this is also unique to the individual and as a single mum I worked part-time for many years in order to spend time with my children was I underemployed well technically yes I was but it was my choice I wanted to drop my children at school erm not at the moment I wanted to be there to pick them up at the gate like other mums and I didn't want anyone coming along saying you should be working full-time not part-time because I valued the time with my children no also I lectured for many years and I just realised today I lectured for many years on a zero-hours contract I never complained it actually suited me erm and erm  erm and I'm delighted I did the work and ever had the choice again  I'd go back and do it so don't judge erm eh uh-uh nae chance for you and on reading the committee report I sorry I will take Rhoda Grant  yeah I appreciate that but I do feel as I listened today and as I read round the subject there are overgeneralisations around this topic erm and I think there has to be an element of individual choice and I appreciate that intervention but on reading the committee report I couldn't help drawing the comparison to the recent Audit Scotland report on early severance the net loss of employees to the public sector in Scotland since two thousand and nine  is forty thousand we are assuming that the loss of forty thousand people has not impacted on the quality and delivery of public services but this will be the subject of a future Audit Scotland report in the autumn however if we can lose forty thousand staff and deliver the same quality of service what does that say about employment in the public sector were they really all overemployed there is no doubting the complexity of underemployment and the challenges in developing measures to gather the data which is stated in paragraph one erm but one figure erm did particularly shock me in this report and it's on page eleven the diagram illustrating underemployment  across Scotland and it shows the city of Dundee it's my home town I understand that the city of Dundee and Shetland with the highest levels of underemployment Dundee I can understand but why should oil-rich Shetland with hotel boats full of workers suffer from unemplo- underemployment could it be that recruiting agencies are bringing in workers from across the UK and wider afield but not working with local agencies to ensure that people in Shetland Islands are given every opportunity for training there may be a better explanation and I look forward to it Presiding Officer I find this topic fascinating erm the speeches interesting and I would like to repeat my thanks to the committee but it is right to say that we have a way to go on this topic thank you I ca- can I just make a point that might help clarify the report to Mary erm it it is where people want to work more hours and indeed want to work at a higher skills level which they have been trained to do it's not saying to people who want to work part-time indeed want to work in less skilled places that they have to do that erm thank you Presiding Officer erm  this has been a good debate I think where a lot of members have made erm very pertinent points erm certainly the inquiry was an eye-opener to me I always thought that any job was better than no job at all but that was before I really saw the impact of underemployment erm we heard about the personal and social impacts very similar to unemployment and Margaret McDougall and Duncan McNeil have mentioned that Duncan especially mentioned health and life ins- expectancy which was very similar to unemployment so there was no gain there for people who were underemployed we also heard about the de-skilling of those that were underemployed never reaching their full potential even into adulthood because they weren't able to use their skills and erm erm continue in that career path that was going to lead to them gaining that full potential and we also heard about poverty people trapped in underemployment with very low wages but they can't give up that job erm because they can't get benefits and I think Alison Johnstone erm pointed that out in her erm contribution to the debate and it was quite heartbreaking to hear some of the stories from erm Citizens Advice when they came in front of the committee erm young people and women are disap- disproportionately affected by underemployment as many people have said erm and underemployment does depend on what people want to do if they want to work in a lesser skilled job or indeed if they want to work part-time to bring up family then they're not considered underemployed and the same can be said about unemployment I think the erm I think it was John Mason that made the  point if you're unemployed you're categorised as unemployed not necessarily we have a category of people who are economically inactive although they might erm dispute that description who are unemployed but don't choose to be em- em-  employed and aren't certainly looking for work at this moment in time so the way  they are measured is different although obviously unemployment is more subjective there is a huge impact on the economy erm because low incomes mean that there's less capacity to spend and we heard evidence of this actually had a negative effect on the economy where w- the recovery was actually being slowed by this so when Gavin Brown was saying underemployment will improve as the economy improves it might be a bit of the-chicken-and-egg because actually underemployment could be stalling erm the improving erm any improvement in the economy erm Marco Biagi also pointed out the impact on erm people who actually had no skills erm the unskilled jobs that were normally available to them erm were not no longer available because graduates were filling those posts and Anne McTaggart made a similar point about erm students' jobs jobs that were normally available for students going through university were now being kept by graduates who couldn't find alternative employment and this was causing poverty and a knock-on  effect there there are solutions there are solutions within erm the Scottish government's erm gift we need more affordable childcare we need increased access to training and education to maintain skills and also to reskills for those who are underemployed and we also need to look at ways of outlawing zero-hours contracts both in the public sector erm for their contractors for grant funding and I think a number of members erm made the point and I think Kezia Dugdale made it erm ve- very well where when we're giving out public-funded grants we need to look at what that company do do they pay their taxes do they have good employment practices erm before we give them that money and I think we need to look at tightening up that criteria to make sure that public funding is spent properly for a public good yes give way to Margo thank you actually there's many people working in childcare and poverty wages in this country and yet   it's the most expensive childcare anywhere else in Europe   so I would suggest that we have to go and look at what happens in the rest of Europe and make sure that we learn from thei- their  their their their good erm example on that I'll take another interv-  I think we need to look at every option and indeed shared childcare as well as something that erm some people use but we have to make sure childcare is there and available not just between the hours of nine to five as some of our lowest paid workers are actually working in supermarkets and the like erm that are beyond that and sometimes the price that they're being asked to pay for childcare means that they shouldn't work at all and that takes them out of erm erm being economically active I think to call in the phrase erm that they may not wish to be erm ma- many speakers also talked about erm the distinct gender profile erm erm that that was erm recognised in underemployment and I mean when we look at erm underemployment in women being at eleven point three percent and eight point seven percent for men erm and I think that erm ma- that the prevalence of this was that a lot of women worked in places where erm there was a lot of part-time work a lot of low-paid work they also took on caring responsibilities for children as we've already spoken to but also erm for elderly pa- parents and also we erm tha- there was a lot of talk about gender erm segregation in the employment market which others have spoken about erm and John Mason was right that we need to broaden the horizons for y- young  erm young women erm Gavin Brown made an interesting point about underemployment for part-time workers in the public sector comparing that  with those in the private sector I think that is possibly it's possibly lower in the public sector because part-time workers in the public sector probably work at a higher level have chosen to job-share and the like and there are better employment practices within the public sector which allow them to do that whereas in the private sector many are in low-paid jobs and I think that creates erm that erm that anomaly Presiding Officer as in usual I have loads more to say but I can't say it as I'm running out of time but can I just ask the Scottish government  to have a close look at outlawing zero-hours contracts I think that's something they can do and certainly the the Procurement Bill can help them can they invest in skilling and re-skilling where it's required and reverse maybe some of the college cur- erm cuts that  erm have done away with part-time flexible courses for when they are very much erm required and we need to think again to tackle this problem thank you Deputy Presiding Officer now the member has referred to affordable childcare and affordable housing and what we really mean is  the cheapest we can get so how do we get round this fact that erm by having affordable childcare for some people who want to work or train other folk are having to work for poverty wages the member give way yes thank you Deputy Presiding Officer I wonder if the member thinks that there might be a connection between the complexities and difficulties of underemployment and unemployment and poor-quality employment and the fact that the British economy is slipping down every single measure of economic performance that I can think of does the member gi- ? I really appreciate that just briefly in terms of the cost of childcare in Scotland I I've asked of va- various reports that established that they don't actually get ben- beneath the detail to why it's more expensive it could be a more qualified workforce  that in terms of childcare the ? are  a need for the expansion of partnership nurseries quite often traditional local authority nurseries who do a fantastic job   they're just not flexible enough to fit in with the working lives of all families particularly female workers thank you very much Presiding Officer Presiding Officer this has been a erm largely erm well-informed debate erm top marks to erm Marco Biagi the former researcher for a very eloquent erm exposé of the the links between erm education and our economy and how we can gain more erm of the benefits of a a first-class education system erm with a full range of economic powers can I also say that I very much enjoyed Duncan McNeil's erm  contribution and I hope he doesn't mind me saying that I found it uncharacteristically erm reflective and indeed erm humorous erm in parts although he was covering some very erm serious issues Scottish government very much erm welcomes the committee's report and erm I hope that committee members will find erm the Scottish government response to its very many recommendations erm very positive erm we have responded positively erm either in part or in full erm to all erm the recommendations we have a desire erm like committee to erm really get underneath erm the the guts of the issue erm and we want to erm seek more information we've already published erm more information with regards to erm older and disabled workers erm but we both seek ways erm to improve erm some of our measurement tools in terms of the Skills Utilisation Measurement Framework erm and also the the National erm Performance Framework as members know the economy is absolutely key and central erm to our endeavours erm recent economic and employment indicators erm are encouraging but the government erm very much recognises erm the ethos of what the committee has articulated and that while a feature erm of this recession is lower unemployment rates than erm anticipated that we should not have a debate erm that falsely puts unemployment versus erm underemployment and that we do have to consider erm both issues erm as part of   a continuum and Scottish government we very much recognise erm the personal impact erm of health poverty and on life chances erm of underemployment as well as unemployment because we know that the fuller participation in the labour market that a better utilisation of skills and enabling more people to reach their potential will not only grow our economy that will alp- so help us to challenge erm inequality and sustainable economic growth that is essential is very much erm the starting erm place and we have to make sure erm that when we do erm get economic recovery we have to make sure that young people women and other equality groups erm get their fair share erm of opportunities because we know there is an economic cost of young people women and other erm equality groups not being able to to reach their full potential Presiding Officer I believe there is a number of actions that the Scottish government can undertake  I believe there are actions that we are currently erm undertaking to tackle erm the long-term causes  erm of underemployment many of our measures through Skills Development Scotland are about co-investment erm with employers in terms of flexible training opportunities erm the low-carbon fund and the energy skills erm fund also other erm work-based learning erm includes Scottish Union Learning very important in reaching erm members of the workforce that other services find hard to reach particularly important erm improving erm literacy erm of many erm workers and it's something that the Scottish government funds to the tune of one point four two two erm million every year let me also mention some erm specific programmes erm Scottish government is investing in erm graduate internship programmes erm essentially paid erm work experience erm that had been very successful and the outcomes of those programmes erm are leading to graduates getting into employment at a rate of between seventy and seventy five erm percent and in terms of very erm specific sectoral responses erm both to erm skill shortages and underemployment erm the skills investment plans and the skills action plan erm action plans erm are crucially important in this regard as Minister for Youth Employment I'm particularly erm interested in the notion of matching older and erm younger  workers erm there are some good examples of this already happening in the private and public sector this very much chimes with our erm Make Young People Your Business erm campaign erm which is about changing hearts and minds erm encouraging erm employers to see the benefits of workforce planning and the benefits and the positive benefits of investing in young people growing your own talent particularly erm in light of ageing workforces so this is an issue that we will erm discuss with the Scottish Employability Forum and of course the whole range of issues erm in and around erm underemployment will be discussed with this forum also I want in the time that I've got remaining Presiding Officer touch on some very erm important erm infrastructure issues erm at its very heart post-sixteen reform is about aligning the world of education erm with the world of work erm and I hope that it is welcomed erm by committee members erm the additional investment in erm taught postgraduate places and undergraduate places that are targeted at key erm economic erm sectors I think in Scotland we know erm that we have yet to reap the full economic benefits of our first-class research and there is much good work erm undergoing with our innovation centres and knowledge transfer partnerships erm in terms of the the college sector there is a sixty one erm million pounds additional to planned budgets and much of that money erm will be used to increase part-time provision erm provision for women returners erm and it's erm an opportunity erm to increase bursaries and erm childcare  erm grants as well now Margaret McDougall and Alison Johnstone amongst others erm mentioned erm childcare and of course this government is making a a a valuable step forward I believe with the Children and Young Persons Act erm with the six hundred hours commitment erm to childcare and early learning but we have to be honest we know that good-quality childcare costs and that it cannot be done on the cheap and yes the costs of childcare are high in Scotland although they're not the highest erm there are many parts in England erm and elsewhere erm where the cost of nursery and childminding provision erm is higher and we do erm have to recognise that this is primarily erm a female workforce and the committee rightly makes the connections between the social care sector erm and erm underpl- erm underemployment I know of one feminist economist erm who argues that once we start getting more men into childcare that  it is only then that we will see erm salaries erm in childcare erm increase so that the solution is not about reducing the costs erm of childcare the answer is about how we better compensate   erm either providers erm or parents and I'm very glad that the Council of Economic Advisors erm is looking at the economic benefits erm of an universal childcare system erm learning from the best in Europe erm looking at models of delivery erm models of funding and how we move towards erm a sustainable erm and affordable universal childcare erm system but of course to complete that journey erm we will indeed need the powers erm of independence because the link between the labour market  erm tax erm and welfare erm is erm rather erm elementary Presiding Officer in the the minute that I have erm left I want to make very specific mention erm of zero-hours con- contracts that've been mentioned by erm many members erm across the chamber today as we've heard from Mister erm Swinney earlier in his contribution the government very much wants to seek more erm information about the prevalence erm of zero-hour contracts erm in Scotland and we are erm considering what steps can be taken as part of Procurement erm Reform Bill erm because you know we want to look at specifically erm how procurement procedures can take account of workforce matters but we do have to recognise that any action erm even within the context of the Procurement Reform Bill erm has to be consistent with employment law erm and indeed erm European  erm procurement legislation and I very much welcomed erm in part that the contribution from Kezia Dugdale and Duncan McNeil who spoke about how we all have a responsibility to do erm absolutely erm everything that we can within the existent powers erm that we have and I am very accepting of that and I just hope erm within that spirit erm that other members like Mister McNeil erm can also accept and perhaps erm open their eyes erm to the benefits erm potentially of this parliament erm having erm a full range of economic erm and employment law powers and the final point erm Presiding Officer is erm that the Scottish government erm for many years now has worked in close partnership erm with the STUC because we are very committed and very publicly signed up erm to promoting whenever and wherever we can erm equality in the workplace and if I can just end by saying erm I c- congratulate erm the committee erm for the the thorough and interesting piece of work erm that they've undertaken you're very generous Presiding Officer thank you erm erm Presiding Officer erm before I begin erm I will certainly welcome a two-minute erm indication erm just to ensure that I come to some concluding remarks I think it's been a very interesting and informative erm debate this afternoon and I I erm think you know a great deal erm has been said around many many of the issues erm and in particular I probably like to start with the areas around the constraints of underemployment but maybe perhaps before I do maybe the definition needs to be looked at again I think it was Stewart Stevenson that that said that the committee hadn't gone into great detail  around the definition of underemployment it was certainly not a term that I was f- you know familiar with until we actually started looking at this report erm and in hearing some of the members this afternoon I I I'm not sure that everyone's grasping  the actual erm definition as was presented erm in the report erm yes erm some people do choose you know to work per- perhaps part-time and and I remember as an employer myself erm erm people coming to me and asking   if they could reduce their hours for for a variety of reasons and it was a judgement I had to make in terms of erm their particular needs and that of the organisation so so that was by choice but that's not the definition the definition is around those who wish to work longer hours those who are seeking additional hours to the hours that they've already got those who have skills but are underskilled perhaps in the jobs that they're doing so I think we have to be very clear around what the definition actually is erm erm and I think you know I I would commend the definition to  to members in the report erm looking at the the various areas of constraints erm round underemployment that was the convenor who started off in his additio- erm erm opening remarks when he mentioned erm young people and women and of course   the the third category erm in that area are people with disabilities and people with disabilities are probably erm overrepresented within the underemployment erm area and it was Capability Scotland themselves who said that you know they're overrepresented in this area and they have less opportunity of perhaps getting into the job market because there is less choice for many people with disabilities given the nature sometimes of their actual disability erm and I I take on the on board the remarks erm by the minister erm and a lot of work has been done to try and and balance this erm inequality area around people with disabilities back into the the workplace perhaps I could also erm commend the opening remarks of the cabinet secretary who I think was taking on board many of the recommendations within the report and it's very welcoming to hear the cabinet secretary and indeed the minister saying that the government do recognise there is more to be done
 and they they're we're willing to look at ensuring that we we get maybe more data more appropriate data so we can actually look at you know not just the getting the evidence but perhaps looking at appropriate solutions towards  this area of underemployment so erm  if you know it's it's taking on the the the whole workforce as a whole and in trying to ensure that we we do match up the erm the work that is available with the skills  that people actually have erm maybe we move into the area erm because we find that under- underemployment isn't in in one particular area erm of the country it is regional and there are certain regional variations erm and we know that it does vary and I learnt something this afternoon that I I didn't know erm and that was that erm Mary Scanlon is a Dundonian and and of course in Dundee the underemployment erm figures there are thirteen point six erm people who are underemployed but in in Aberdeenshire erm in part of my own constituency there the numbers are actually about  nine point one so that variations and I do apologise to members from the Central Belt for for not actually giving figures for for their particular area but  you know we also need to ask the local authorities themselves about collecting appropriate data to try and ensure that when they're looking at their employable strategies within their own local authority areas that they have the most appropriate and up-to-date data erm to try and resolve some of the problems around underemployment so the government have given a commitment to look at this and I think the committee were asking local authorities too erm to try and collect the appropriate data to ensure that we try and find solutions   to this problem absolutely erm I thank the member and I think erm we at the outset erm and I think it was perhaps Gavin Brown who reinforced the fact that this is a very complex matter erm I think John Mason i- is putting his finger on the complexities around perhaps erm this area of collecting an appropriate area and in understanding the definition but I think in collecting that information if if the local authority and certainly government is clear about the information they're trying to collect around the definition erm I'm sure the the the data would be informative a- around collection of data and information I I think we must commend erm Marco Biagi for being the champion for the graduates and certainly the thirteen thousand if I remember right erm of the constituents that he actually represents erm erm and I think he he he probably does erm probably deserve the accolade of being the swot on the EET Committee  erm with reference to that erm I think the   the other area we want to look at is the  in-work poverty a term Presiding Officer that I'm I'm certainly not comfortable with erm and you know can I commend again erm the contribution from  Duncan McNeil I think erm it was said with erm a great deal of of emotion passion erm and it was delivered I think extremely well and I think Mister McNeil was absolutely right you know for for many people they will take a job regardless you know because people in the main want to work well what we're finding is that people are actually working and
 the pay cheque at the end of the day is not rewarding enough and the benefit system as is and the the problem I think with the the welfare reform is that people are finding themselves in even greater poverty  than they were before and of course students themselves are also in this area of of this erm erm in-work poverty in that quite often they work long hours again for very little reward thank you very much Presiding Officer and it was erm it was Doctor McCormick from the Rowntree erm erm Foundation who said that for many of these people that are in this erm revolving door of insecurity with regard to the employment erm and I think  you know when when we look at this  in terms of the employment of erm erm young people erm people who are trying to get more work or disabled people the well-being factor is one that we need to also consider accept erm erm I thank the erm member for the intervention I was actually gonna finish on a positive thought however erm ? erm and that was to say that we do welcome the the the erm al- albeit slight economic growth within the Scottish economy at the moment erm and I think here we we we need to look erm to this our brighter future i- in terms of that and in addressing the problems erm it's it's probably se- the solution to this complexity of the underemployment and Presiding Officer can I can I offer my thanks to the convenor and to the other members of the committee and certainly the clerking team for I I think it is a report which I think Gavin Brown said as well it is is one  that probably poses more questions than answers at the moment however I believe this government is up to answering the questions that has been put before it and I commend the motion in the name of Murdo Fraser to the erm  to the chamber thank you does the member give way erm I thank the member for giving way erm I mean he's touched already on the issue of a definition and he's now saying about collecting data I just wonder if he thinks there's practical problems in there because if it's based on each an individual person's attitude and what they want you know how is it really possible to collect that data in a kind of objective way
