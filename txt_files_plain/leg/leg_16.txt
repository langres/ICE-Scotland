parliament has confered statutory rights on employees often implementing EU law many employment rights are not of a financial nature they include for example the right to written particular subterms of employment those employment rights which do have financial consequences often involve small sums for example two weeks' pay most employment rights can only be enforced in employment tribunals with an appeal line to the employment appeal tribunal until recently proceedings could be brought without any fee being paid that changed when a fees order was introduced in July of twenty thirteen under the fees order the amount which must be paid before a claim or appeal can be dealt with depends on whether the claim is classified as type A or type B type A claims generally require little prehearing work and only a short hearing type B claims generally require more of the tribunal's time they include unfair dismissal equal pay and discrimination claims for a single claimant the fees in the employment tribunal total three hundred and ninety pounds for a type A claim and one thousand two hundred pounds for a type B claim the fees order makes provision for the remission of those fees if a claimant's disposable capital and that of their partner erm totals less than three thousand pounds the amount of remission depends on the claimant's gross monthly income and that of their partner and the number of children they have a couple earning the minimum wage would not qualify for remission in a type A case but they might get some remission in a type B case a fee may also be remitted if the Lord Chancellor is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances which in practice means exceptional hardship successful claimants may obtain an order for reimbursement of the fees by the losing party but in practice most successful claimants do not recover the full amount order to be paid and many recover nothing at all this appeal arises out of an application for judicial review in which the trade union UNISON argues that the making of the fees order was not a lawful exercise of the Lord Chancellor's statutory power to prescribe fees because the fees imposed interfere unjustifiably with the right of access to justice under both the common law and EU law frustrate the operation of parliamentary legislation granting employment rights and discriminate unlawfully against women and other protected groups the application was dismissed by the High Court and its decision was upheld by the court of appeal the Supreme Court unanimously allows UNISON's appeal it holds that the fees order is unlawful under both domestic and EU law because it has the effect of preventing access to justice and it's also discriminatory the court's decision is based principally on the common law right of access to the courts that right is a vital component of the rule of law it is needed to ensure that the laws created by parliament including those creating employment rights are applied and enforced the effect of a right is that access to the courts and tribunals cannot be taken away without parliament's express authority and parliament did not give that authority when it empowered the Lord Chancellor to prescribe fees the court bases its conclusion that the fees are inconsistent with access to justice on a number of factors one is that the fees have resulted in such a substantial and sustained fall in the number of claims being brought that it points to the conclusion that a significant number of people have found the fees unaffordable secondly surveys have confirmed that people who notified ACAS of claims but did not present claims to the employment tribunal gave as a reason that they could not afford the fees thirdly worked examples of claimants in low to middle income households  confirmed that they cannot afford the fees without sacrificing ordinary and reasonable expenditure for substantial periods of time fourthly the evidence establishes that the fees have had a particularly deterrent effect on claims of low monetary value or claims where no financial remedy is available indeed the fees render it futile to bring many such claims given the level of the fees relative to the amo- to the amount of any financial award which might be obtained and the prospects of recovering a- any amount awarded the fees order is also unlawful because it contravenes the EU law guarantee of an effective remedy before a tribunal it imposes disproportionate limitations on the enforcement of EU employment rights in addition the fees order is indirectly discriminatory contrary to the Equality Act of two thousand and ten a higher proportion of women bring type B claims than type A claims and so the higher fees that are charged for type B claims put women at a particular disadvantage the higher fees cannot be justified on the basis of the objectives of the fees order which were to transfer part of the cost burden of the tribunals from tax payers to users of their services to deter unmeritorious claims and to encourage the earlier settlement of claims it has not been shown that the higher fees for type B claims are any more effective than lower fees in transferring the cost of the service from tax payers to users or if they are more effective in deterring unmeritorious claims or that they are more effective in encouraging the earlier settlement of claims the fees order is therefore quashed the Lord Chancellor has undertaken to reimburse fees already paid
