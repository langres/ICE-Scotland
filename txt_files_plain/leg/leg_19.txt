 the court's role in relation to prerogative powers  is dependent on the nature  and the subject matter  of the power or its exercise  particularly on whether  the subject matter  is justiciable  whether the exercise  of a prerogative power is reviewable  depends on the subject matter  and the context of the power  and of the challenge  some functions exercised or decisions taken  are non-justiciable  among them are matters of high polity  and political judgment  the court does not have the tools or standards  to assess the legality of such matters  in my view  the advice given in relation to the prorogation decision  is a matter involving high polity  and political judgment  this is political territory  and decision-making  which cannot be measured against legal standards  but only by political judgments  I do not exact the submission  that the prorogation contravenes the rule of law  it is for parliament to decide  when it will sit  and it routinely does so  it is not for the courts  to devise further restraints  on prorogation  which go beyond the limits  which parliament has chosen to provide
