let me be clear no one in any civilized country including Scotland has the right to take the life of another whatever offence that individual perceives  that he or she has suffered it is vitally important in modern society that this that respect and tolerance for others of every race creed colour ethnic origin or religious belief is maintained and protected by the law of the land this was a brutal barbaric and horrific crime resulting from intolerance  and which led to the death of a wholly innocent man who openly expressed beliefs which differed from yours but who also exercised an understanding and tolerance of others whose religious beliefs might be different from his own it is accepted by you in the agreed narrative that  this was religiously motivated and as I've said I accept the dean of faculty's submissions that this was not against the Ahmadi community I note with considerable concern that you have expressed no remorse whatsoever for this appalling crime that attitude continues to this date all as evidenced by the contents of the criminal justice social work report indeed from your early pronouncements after you first appeared in court it is clear that you're proud of what you did and you do not consider what you did was wrong what is particularly disturbing from some of your later comments to the social worker  who prepared the court report is the fact that if met with similar circumstances in the future you would do the same again I sentence you to life imprisonment for all of the reasons given in above the punishment part I would have imposed would've been thirty years I shall reduce that by three years that's the punishment part is twenty seven years your stated motive as disclosed in the agreed narrative was that you consider that Mr Shah had offended your religious beliefs and had thus hurt your feelings although you had never previously met the deceased you decided that you had a duty to kill him this was a barbaric premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of a much loved man who was a pillar of the local community he is described as a peaceful and peace loving man and a family man this attack on your victim was an appalling display of merciless violence you repeatedly stabbed Mr Shah and when a shop assistant bravely disarmed you you did not desist but determined to end his life you continued the assault by repeatedly and forcefully punching kicking and stamping on your victim's head and neck you ignored the pleas of Mr Shah's brother to stop the attack and such was the force of your repeated blows that some of the head and neck injuries found at post-mortem were described as being more commonly seen in victims of road accidents what is so chilling about this attack is that what you did was calculated and deliberate
