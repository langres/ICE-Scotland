it is a matter of established public policy that the law should prevent should seek to prevent children from engaging prematurely in sexual activity and that it should deter and punish those who predate on children one option which may be available to legislators is to make any sexual activity with a child under the age of sixteen a criminal offence but it has long been recognised  that when someone engages in sexual activity with an older child he or she may reasonably believe that the child is older than in truth the child is in other words that he or she is no longer a child and can fully and legally consent to and engage in sexual activity in the past statute law allowed for this circumstance by giving someone who was under the age of twenty four a defence if he or she had had consensual sex with a child between the ages of thirteen and sixteen that defence was that he or she reasonably believed that the child was over the age of sixteen and I'll call that the reasonable belief defence also in the past the reasonable belief defence was excluded if the accused person had previously been charged in court with what was called a like offence which was principally the offence of having consensual sexual intercourse with a child aged between thirteen and sixteen and it was intended as a result that the reasonable belief defence would be available to an accused person only once about ten years ago the Scottish law commission conducted a review on the law of sexual offences some of the commission's recommendations were adopted by the Scottish ministers and others were modified in the draft legislation which became the Sexual Offences Scotland Act two thousand and nine the Scottish parliament in enacting the two thousand and nine act chose to preserve the reasonable belief defence and consistently with the law commission's recommendation did not confine it to accused persons under the age of twenty four at the same time it provided that the defence would not be available if the accused had previously been charged by the police with what it called a relevant sexual offence the offences which fell within the definition of relevant sexual offence were not confined to consensual sexual behaviour with children aged between thirteen and sixteen instead the term relevant sexual offence covered a wide range of sexual offences both consensual and non-consensual where the victim was of any age under the age of sixteen in explaining the proposal to the Scottish parliament in a policy memorandum and in evidence to the parliamentary committee representatives of the Scottish government justified the proposed restriction of the reasonable belief defence as a means of preventing a serial sexual predator who had relied on the defence and been acquitted from escaping justice in future by relying on the defence again in his defence of the measure before this court the Lord Advocate recognised that that justification for the restriction of the defence did not stand up because reasonable belief was irrelevant  and provided no defence to many of the offences which had been classed as relevant sexual offences further an earlier police charge might not have resulted in a court appearance and the assertion of the reasonable belief defence at all instead he founded his argument on another justification namely that the police charge operated as an official warning against consensual sexual activity with an older child which would or should discourage him or her from such activity it is undoubted that certain sexual charges could operate as a relevant warning and could form the basis of excluding the reasonable belief defence but had the earlier charges done so in this case when aged fourteen the appellant had been charged by the police with sexual offences which involved showing online pornographic material to a young boy and exposing himself to children a decision was made that the appellant would not be prosecuted and the case did not proceed to a children's hearing notably also none of the charges involved consensual a- sexual activity with an older child when he was nineteen the appellant was charged with having engaged in sexual intercourse with a girl aged fourteen years and eleven months there is no dispute that the th- that this sex was consensual he sought to plead that he reasonably believed that she was sixteen or over but the provision in the two thousand and nine act excludes that defence so he challenged the provision on the basis that it failed to strike a fair balance between the public interest and erm his human right to respect for his private life and therefore that the provision was beyond the legislative competence of the Scottish parliament after the appeal court of the high court of justiciary rejected his application he has appealed to this court this court unanimously allows his appeal Lord Reed and I have both written judgements with which the other justices concur in short the court holds that the interference with the ap- erm with the appellant's article eight right is not proportionate because the prior charges do not give the supposed warning against consensual sexual activity with children aged between thirteen and sixteen the problem with the provision is the range of offences chosen to fall within the definition of  relevant sexual offences which cannot be reconciled with the justification put forward for the interference with citizens' private lives it it will be possible for the list of offences to be amended to better reflect the apparent aim of the legislation but as it stands it is not possible to interpret the relevant provision of the two thousand and nine act narrowly to bring it within the competence of the Scottish parliament it is therefore not law the this court remits the proceedings to the high court of justiciary to exercise its powers in the light of this judgement
