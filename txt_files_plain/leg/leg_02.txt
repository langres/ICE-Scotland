on the question of procedure with which my learned friend opened this court has the expressed statutory power to do that which a judge of the court of session sitting without a jury might do that is section one hundred and twenty three subsection two of the act it cannot be the case and I don't think my learned friend suggests it is that faced with the petition which is irrelevant this court should merely wring its hands and say what can we do and echoing my learned friend why else are we here we're here to discuss three discrete legal issues and if any one of them is resolved in Mister Carmichael's favour then this matter ends now there's no need to go back to eighteen sixty eight section one to three is clear erm and in any event my learned friend erm very fairly erm puts in the bundle although I don't think we've heard of it thus far erm a case which makes it quite clear that this court can dismiss on grounds of irrelevancy it's the case of ? against Gordon which the petitioner submitted as part of the supplementary bundle at erm six point twenty seven and perhaps six point twenty seven and I'm looking at page one zero four five of the joint bundle where that master of procedure Lord McLaren formed part of the election court erm and so says ? page one seven four of the report one zero four five of the joint bundle Lord McLaren as regards the statement in articles one and two dealing with charges of bribery and treating I'm of the opinion that there's insufficient specification so what he did there was require further particulars and in the next paragraph petitioners have indicated their intention to amend and I propose if you'd allow such amendments as regard article three dealing with illegal payments or payments not included I think the respondent's objection ought to be sustained there are no relevant averments in the article upon which the petitioners would in my opinion be entitled to allowance of proof so His Lordship draws a useful distinction there erm if it's a plea of want of specification then the appropriate thing to is to require further particulars I make no such complaint here if the complaint is relevancy then the appropriate course of action is dismiss my learned friend said well relevancy is all about fair notice no it's not a plea of want of specification is about want of fair notice a plea of irrelevancy is that it is bad in law and that is a summon substance of my submission on all three heads a- and the court bears in mind the purpose of this hearing as agreed in advance it was to discuss these three discrete legal issues that's why we have no statement of evidence rule sixty nine point thirteen says put in a statement of the evidence you intend to lead we intend to lead no evidence at this part of the trial because we say the thing is irrelevant o- other than that erm my Lady my Lords I don't intend to detain the court on questions of procedure  erm erm if erm the result is that I am successful on any one of the three heads then I would move the court simply to dismiss as erm previously discussed if not then I don't demur from the situation a by-order would be appropriate issue if I might take issue three first now erm because it's it's is quickest to deal with issue three is effectively conceded because my learned friend says hands up a purpose to affect the general election doesn't work I agree with that but he says look at my note of argument I'm I'm really offering to prove something else the short point I reiterate is he offers to prove both because the rules make it quite clear we can look at the petition and the note he offers to prove either or affect the election or affect the general election and one of those doesn't work and his analogy with the factory ? case was telling he said well if I come to court and say I was hurt and the machinery was unsafe or if it wasn't unsafe it wasn't properly guarded well those are both relevant those are both relevant averments of fact here he says you either intended to affect the general election or you intended to affect your own election they're both averments of fact and one of them will not wash e- erm while we're o- we're on issue three my my learned friend despite effectively conceding it then he goes on to say but you can determine it now on the pleadings in his favour he says because the only reasonable influence is an intention to affect the election but that can't be right because on the petitioner's own averments there is another inference i e an intention to affect the general election and in any event we are not here to discuss a motion for ? that was not one of the agreed issues that's all I have to say about issue three erm and I can be similarly fairly brief on issue one my learned friend refers to the report from the select committee erm a- and it's our report which he has to accept there's only so much you can take from it because it's not a complete report that report does not fall within the ratio of paper because it's not a clear statement from the promoter of the bill and if I can remind the court that when when we do have a statement from the promoter Mister ? we have a statement about the bill in its unamended form what is subsequently passed the bill in its unamended form my learned friend says you can't use paper if the  promoter didn't get his way he did he promoted a bill in the terms passed by parliament and the fact that there was a an amendment that was rejected tells us nothing other than that parliament didn't deem it necessary to amend when we go back to what was actually said at the second and third readings it's all about vilification and slander and what it's not about at any point in the discussion prior to the inception of the act is self talking and I do come back to what Lord ? said in ? it can hardly be only now in two thousand and fifteen that one can contemplate that a politician might say something about himself with which others disagree that possibility is surely as old as politics itself and if parliament intended to catch it it might be expected to have said so expressly again that's all I I have to say about issue one so that just leaves us then with with issue two now my learned friend looked at the Banks case primarily on the reference to issue one but he was then very critical of counsel for Mister Banks and it's interesting to look at why that was so he said I would have thought there could be no stronger example of a political statement to state that one was the official candidate of such and such a party but Mister Lewis spoke falsely and he knowingly spoke falsely so the primary basis upon which the petitioner's case is put in the pleadings and in the note that falsity turns this into the personal is on his own submission unfounded the primary basis upon which the petitioners put their case in both the petition and the note of argument erm and for the note I have here in in mind paragraph thirteen of the note which is that the falsity of a statement turns it into personal because it impacts on trustworthiness is on his own submission unfounded now we've heard of ? and Phinneas Finn of the Reichstag in nineteen thirty three of Douglas Stringfellow beg leave to query what assistance we actually get from any of that and I urge the court not to be diverted from what is in essence a very simple question for the purposes of section one hundred and six a statement is either personal or it is not it cannot be both political and personal Woolace could not be clearer on that now My Lady in the chair asks my learned friend is Woolace binding we are in the UK election court a statutory tribunal which has been judicially reviewed in Woolace I cannot think of any situation in which a tribunal that has been reviewed by a court would be entitled to simply thumb its nose at that decision in my submission Woolace is binding if I'm wrong about that it would be most unfortunate to find a different approach north and south of the border on fundamentally important issues like this and I recall my learned friend's glowing endorsement yesterday and today of Mister ? QC who my learned friend indicates has more knowledge of electoral law than anyone else in the kingdom well in ? I'll just give the court the reference ? the first of ? six point twenty two at paragraph one hundred and thirteen joint bundle page nine three two commissioner ? described Lord Justice Thomas' exposition of the law in Woolace as magisterial and at paragraph one hundred and seventeen of the same case  in which he was sitting as the election court he said he was bound by Woolace my submission he was correct in both of those descriptions looking beyond the technical into the substance there is no dissonance between paragraph one hundred and eleven and paragraph one hundred and twenty one in Woolace it would be highly surprising if the Lord Chief Justice had made such an elementary error having told us what the law is at paragraph one one one and ten paragraphs later forgotten what he'd said all he says at one two one is that a comment made in a political context and under this act we're always going to be dealing with a comment made in a political context can transcend the political and impact upon the personal no My Lord it means it transcends transcends the political so that it is no longer political and it becomes the personal that's the way His Lordship puts it at one two one erm and at one two four now it's easy to see how that can be the case in the context of attacks it is less easy to see how that can work in the context of self talking but what it can't do is to mean that as soon as one speaks falsely it becomes personal and that is shown by the further point my learned friend makes he says you gotta look at this in the way that an objective bystander would look at it would the bystander understand that a comment was being made about personal character or conduct the objective bystander hearing a false statement doesn't know it's false he only finds out later as was the case here that there is subsequent discovery of the falsity that discovery of the falsity weeks later does not operate some sort of time machine take one back and turn the statement when it was made into something other than that which it was so when my learned friend responded to My Lord Matthews' question by saying it relates to his personal conduct in telling a lie he advances a proposition which is wrong in law erm and it is here that my learned friend's submission faces an insuperable difficulty he's repeatedly asked about the categorisation of the leak and he began by emphasising that the criticism is not the leak that was dealt with by cabinet and he could not suggest otherwise why because it's political my learned friend then suggested that Lord Matthews was mixing two questions up well with respect he is not with respect the nub of this matter is the very one alighted upon by Lord Matthews because unless the allegation of leak or more appropriately and I'll come back to this an allegation of knowledge of leak was a personal matter a false denial of that simply cannot be a personal matter pressed on this issue this morning my learned friend said I find it quite difficult to categorise an allegation of leaking the document as either personal or political well if this court finds itself in that self-same difficulty Mister Carmichael wins because then we are squarely within the dictum of Mister Justice ? from ? the narrow construction means in the case of doubt it is resolved in favour of Mister Carmichael mhm mhm right right right right mhm just repeat that last proposition Mister Dunlop the primary aha I mean it's both political and personal
