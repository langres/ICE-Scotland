Mister Carlyle was a property developer in two thousand and seven he wanted to develop houses beside the famous golf course at Gleneagles in Perthshire he needed finance from the bank to pursue that venture  because the Ryder Cup was to be held at the Gleneagles course the sellers of the land wanted the purchaser to complete the the exterior of the development well in advance so that there were no incomplete houses visible when the world's media came to film the contest to achieve that the sellers wished to include in the contract of sale a clause which provided that if the development was not completed by the thirty first of March two thousand and eleven they would be able to buy back the land at the price which the purchaser had paid for it such a buy back would have very serious financial consequences for the purchaser because of this Mister Carlyle wanted to obtain a commitment from his bankers the Royal Bank of Scotland that they would not that they they would fund not only the purchase of the site   but also its development in discussions with the bank's representatives between March and June two thousand and seven he made this clear and the bank acknowledged his request on the fourteenth of June two thousand and seven a bank representi- representative telephoned him to tell him that it was all approved on the strength of that assurance he paid the deposit and entered into the contract to buy the land in August  two thousand and eight after the financial crisis had taken hold the bank informed Mister Carlyle that they would not  erm advance erm funds to develop the site shortly afterwards the bank raised an action against him for repayment of the one point four million pounds which he'd had advanced Mister Carlyle defended the action and claimed damages arguing that the bank were in breach of contract erm to provide him with funding but to seven hundred thousand pounds for the development the case proceeded to proof and in May two thousand and ten the Lord Ordinary Lord Lenney after hearing the evidence held that the telephone conversation of fourteenth June two thousand and seven in the context of the previous discussions amounted to a binding promise to advance both the purchase price of the land and funding for the development the bank appealed and in September twenty thirteen the Inner House of the court of session allowed the appeal holding that the telephone conversation had amounted  only to a report of an internal decision of the bank to approve funding in principle Mister Carlyle appealed to this court in a unanimous decision this court allows the appeal in the judgement of the court erm the in the in its judgement the court noticed the limited power of an appeal court to reverse the findings of fact of a judge at first instance and the need to show that the judge has gone plainly wrong this court expresses the view that on the recorded evidence it might have concluded that the bank had not entered into a binding promise to provide the development funding but it states that there was erm in the in- unusual circumstances of this case a reasonable basis in the evidence for the Lord Ordinary to have reached the view which he did on an objective analysis of what the parties said and did therefore this court considers that the judge had not gone plainly wrong the fact that the commitment lacked detail and would have been superseded by a detailed loan agreement did not of itself prevent the commitment from having legal effect once the Lord Ordinary was satisfied that there was a binding promise he was both entitled and required to look for ways to give effect to that promise
