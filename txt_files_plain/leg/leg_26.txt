this appeal arises out of an accident in which Mrs Robinson a lady then aged seventy six was knocked over on a shopping street in the centre of Huddersfield by a group of men two of the men were police officers and the third was a suspected drug dealer whom they were attempting to arrest the officers approached him and erm seize hold of him as he was standing outside a shop with Mrs Robinson standing close by as the officers struggled with the suspect he backed into Mrs Robinson who fell over and the three men fell on top of her causing her to be injured the officers had foreseen that the suspect would attempt to escape and that anyone nearby might be injured but they had not noticed that Mrs Robinson was in his immediate vicinity when they attempted to make the arrest the principal questions to be decided in the appeal are whether the officers were under any duty to take reasonable care for Mrs Robinson's safety and if they were whether they were in breach of that duty the judge held that the officers had been negligent towards Mrs Robinson but that the police were immune from claims against them in negligence the court of appeal found that most claims against the police when engaged in their core functions will fail the third stage of the Caparo test a test which they derived from a previous decision of the House of Lords in a case called Caparo to the effect that the duty of care will not exist unless its imposition is fair just and reasonable on the particular facts of a case the court of appeal also found that it was the suspect not the police officers who had caused Mrs Robinson to be injured by attempting to escape finally the court of appeal considered that even if the officers had owed Mrs Robinson a duty of care they had not acted in breach of it Mrs Robinson has appealed to the Supreme Court the Supreme Court unanimously allows her appeal the lead judgment is given by myself and Lady Hale and Lord Hodge agree with it Lord Mance and Lord Hughes reach the same conclusion by different reasoning the majority of the court reject the idea that there is a Caparo test which applies to all claims in the modern law of negligence and that in consequence the court will only impose a duty of care where it consi- where it considers it fair just and reasonable to do so on the particular facts it is only where established legal principles do not provide a clear answer to the question before the court that the court may need to consider whether a duty of the scope contended for would be a reasonable development of the law consistent with established principles in other words fair just and reasonable this case on the other hand involves the application of well-established principles of law of negligence and does not require the court to consider any development of the law in accordance with the general law of tort the police are generally under a duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing injury to persons whom it is reasonably foreseeable will be injured if such care is not taken the legal decisions on which the court of appeal based its contrary view were not concerned with the police themselves causing injury but were mostly concerned with their failing to prevent harm caused by third parties in particular the decision of the House of Lords in the case of Hill and the chief constable of West Yorkshire which held that the police were not liable in damages to the mother of one of the victims of Peter Sudcliffe the so-called Yorkshire ripper for failing to catch him before he murdered her daughter is not authority for the proposition that the police enjoy a general immunity in respect of anything done by them in the course of investigating or preventing crime the effect of the decision in the case of Hill was more limited but the police do not erm normally owe a duty of care to protect the public from harm caused by third parties through the performance of their function of investigating crime that is consistent with the general approach of a common law it does not normally impose liability for ommissions or more particularly for a failure to prevent harm caused by the conduct with third parties on the other hand the police may be under a duty of care like anybody else to protect an individual from a danger of injury which they have themselves created in the present case the arresting officer was aware of the risk that the suspect would attempt to escape and of the risk to members of the public in that event he would not have attempted the arrest at a time when he was aware that someone was in harm's way but he simply failed to notice that Mrs Robinson was there although she was in plain sight in no circumstances the officers owed a duty of care towards Mrs Robinson  and were in breach of that duty Mrs Robinson's erm injuries were caused by their breach of their duty of care she was injured as a result of being exposed to a danger erm erm danger resulting from the attempt to erm by the suspect to escape from which they had a duty of care to protect her the court emphasises that the duty of the police is only to take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances and that it is important that the courts do not impose unrealistically demanding standards of care on police officers acting in the course of their operational duties that is most obviously the case where decisions have to be made in stressful circumstances with little or no time for considered thought but the present case does not fall into that category the officers waited for an appropriate moment to arrest the suspect and simply failed to notice an elderly lady who was standing next to him
