ladies and gentlemen this may be the first time you've ever been in a court it may be that what you learned about what goes on in a court is from programmes on televisions films plays but this has not been a play or a film this is a real case involving real people and it involves you making a very important decision you may be forgiven for thinking at times this was the trial of Hector Dick not the trial of Nat Fraser you may well think that there should be other people sitting in that dock and you may well be right the crown case against Nat Fraser is that he instructed instigated and organised the murder of his wife it is not and never has been that he actually killed her and you might say well advocate depute how do you expect us to convict a man of murder when you don't have a body and you can't tell us how she was killed if she was killed how do we even know she's dead are you prepared to hold it established that Arlene Fraser is dead well I suggest ladies and gentlemen that should be quite an easy task she was a dedicated mother her mother told you that actually to her surprise it turned out Arlene was a a fantastic mother so the notion that she would abandon the children is ridiculous no birthdays no Christmas presents no cards at Easter no anniversaries no Mother's Day card nothing this is not a woman who's packed her stuff and left her clothes are there her personal possessions are there and I say to you ladies and gentlemen the only possible outcome of an assessment of that evidence is that she is dead now was she murdered the circumstances help you on a Tuesday morning that's the one day that she's not at college so if this is a random hit then the person's very lucky because of all the days of the week he or she picks the right day is a burglary gone wrong burglars go in and ransack a burglar would never take the body so let's think then of the possibilities is some random serial killer wandering around Elgin who happens only to target Arlene Fraser that's ridiculous I suggest what else is it I say ladies and gentlemen it points conclusively to it being a murder and when you bring all the strands of the various evidence together  points to a premeditated murder if it's a premeditated murder that requires a motive on the evidence there's only one person in the entire world who has a motive to kill Arlene Fraser what would be the evidence of motive you could start with the evidence of the statement Mister Fraser gave to the police on Wednesday the twenty ninth of April nineteen ninety eight somebody gave me a whisper that Arlene was seeing a man who worked in Landmark furniture I did ask her if she was having a carry-on with another man and she just told me no not to be so stupid but it just festered in my head and kept gnawing at me and I did ask myself was it really happening was she clever or was I imagining things so here's the jealousy I suggest ladies and gentlemen this was plainly not happy marriage divorce was on the cards and Nat Fraser knew that Nat Fraser knew this was the end not that it might be not that he hoped she might come back and it'll all blow over he knew and then look at the possible financial consequences of divorce you have evidence Pedor Taylor told you money was important you heard evidence from Arlene Fraser's solicitor that they got nowhere near understanding the financial worth of Nat Fraser item five in the first joint minute Arlene Fraser and the accused Nat Gordon Fraser hold a joint life policy of insurance with a death benefit of a hundred thousand pounds even where there's not a body payment could be made while we're on motive let's consider what motive Hector Dick could have there was an idea floated that he appeared to have some sexual attraction at some time towards Arlene Fraser is it the case that he made an advance on her and killed her let's tease this out let's think about it what gain would he have financially well none on the evidence absolutely none you may ask to consider that the possibility that Hector Dick murdered the young wife of his best man without any knowledge instruction counsel instigation anything to do with Nat Fraser completely independent there's just coincidence that at that time in the midst of this bitter breakup of a marriage Hector Dick comes along the big farmer goes in kills her and goes away again he's an odd character I wouldn't buy a used car of Hector Dick certainly wouldn't have him round for dinner but nobody's asking you to do that you have to look at his evidence with great caution and he explained that Nat Fraser wanted the Ford Fiesta he needed a car in the next couple of days there was an urgency about this there's no doubt the Ford Fiesta car was acquired on the twenty seventh through a meeting between Hector Dick and Kevin Ritchie at the farm this is what lawyers call a circumstantial case for hundreds of years lawyers have talked about a cable analogy if you think about a cable being made up of many strands which individually are not particularly strong but the more strands which are applied to the cable the stronger the cable gets the vent in the bedroom the vent above the door in the bedroom was askew why on learning of his wife's disappearance would the first thing that occurs to Mister Fraser is a curious thing to think about you might think why mention the safe hiding spot unless of course he knew that's precisely what they will find I suggest that was a quite despicable line adopted by him in a cynical attempt to put people off the trail but it doesn't work I suggest ladies and gentlemen sometimes in a lengthy case there is a little bit of evidence that takes everyone by surprise sometimes it's not expected or noticed or anticipated and it came from Grand Fraser the van boy working for Nat Fraser he's the alibi he said Nat Fraser said why would Nat Fraser make such a comment the morning after Arlene Fraser was missing what is there to point the finger at if no crime's been committed and I ask you ladies and gentlemen to take account of it and I have every confidence that you will consider this case very carefully it's a big important decision to make and I urge you to analyse probe test challenge test again the crown case but I invite you ladies and gentlemen that once you've done that you will find that justice requires one outcome and I ask you ladies and gentlemen to find Nat Fraser guilty of the murder of Arlene Fraser thank you very much
