on fourth November two thousand and eleven at about eleven thirty p m Surjit Singh Chhokar finished working and returned to the house he was staying at with his partner Elisabeth Bryce he was no doubt looking forward to relaxing and perhaps enjoying some of the meal he was carrying  instead of that he was the victim of an ambush which cost him his life the jury was satisfied that you were responsible for his brutal murder which was  on the evidence all on account of the theft of a giro worth just one hundred and ten pound seventy along with your nephew and David Montgomery who was recruited to drive you and who on his own admission was prepared to get involved in an assault you travelled the short distance to Overtown it is plain that your only purpose was violence and that you must have had a knife to hand when the trap was sprung you were not content to let Andrew Coulton use his baton on Chhokar but you inflicted three stab wounds on his body in the most despicable and cowardly fashion thereafter you attempted to cover your tracks and in large measure you succeeded in doing so now many years later you are here to answer for your crime it has been a long period for Chhokar's family they have waited patiently and with quiet dignity for some measure of justice your conviction and your sentence will not provide any sort of satisfaction they would rather this had never happened that Chhokar's father could have spent his declining years with his son and that Chhokar himself could have gone on to have a long and happy life the victim's statements I have read cannot begin to address what his family must have gone through yet I must pass a sentence on you to reflect as best I can both your circumstances and those of this offence since you have been convicted of murder the law allows for only one sentence but as a component part of that sentence I must select a period which must pass before you can apply for parole whether or not you are ever released once that time has passed will be for others to decide in light of the premeditated violence in this case that period would have been one of twenty years but since you spent around four months in custody awaiting your first trial it will instead be nineteen years and eight months subject to that the sentence which will run from fifth October twenty sixteen is one of life imprisonment
