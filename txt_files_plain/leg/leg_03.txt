the agreed crown narra- narrative discloses an extraordinary complex and intricate web of deceit and lies this agreed narrative of the background facts discloses a wicked course of conduct a course of controlling and manipulative behaviour while through your solicitor and within the criminal justice social work report you have expressed remorse for your actions in passing I have noted the comment of the author of the report on page five of the report of their impression that the expression of remorse was superficial and I will take that into account in any sentence your solicitor correctly described your conduct at the last hearing on seventeenth September twenty fifteen as quotes deplorable quotes and today as quotes dreadful quotes I would reinforce that I would describe your conduct as quotes deplorable callous despicable and shameful close quotes on reflection about the whole circumstances of this case I think the best word to sum up what you have done is the word cruel the word cruel means quotes willfully causing pain or suffering to others and feeling no concern about it quotes in my view you were cruel to Michael McDonagh to Margaret McDonagh and to Nichola McDonagh my sympathies go out to the McDonagh family and friends for their terrible loss but it is important that I record you have not been prosecuted for the deaths of either Margaret McDonagh nor Nichola McDonagh and my task today is to sentence you on the charge to which you have pled guilty the agreed crown narrative which took over one hour to read in open court demonstrates a very high level of planning over months and months with the deceit increasing and the lies escalating to a frenzy particularly in the weeks leading up to May twenty thirteen I reject any suggestion from the psychological reports before the court that you were being quote spontaneous quotes spontaneous quotes that is inconsistent with the agreed narrative of the facts
