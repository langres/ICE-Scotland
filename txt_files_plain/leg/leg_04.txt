extremely difficult to find words appropriate to describe the dreadful crime to which you pleaded guilty Karen Buckley was a young woman in the prime of life she was a visitor to Glasgow studying to expand her knowledge in furtherance of her career in nursing she was a much-loved member of a close and united family to you she was a stranger who appears tragically to have accepted a lift in your car in a matter of minutes for some unknown and inexplicable reason you destroyed her young life and devastated a family not satisfied with killing her so brutally you went to extraordinary lengths over several days to cover up your actions by attempting to destroy her body you also concocted a story to tell the police and to ensure that you remember the lies which you had told you even wrote the story down eventually only after your detention you revealed where you had hidden Miss Buckley's body although by that time the police already knew the location but still you continued to lie about what had happened and on this occasion you fabricated a second story claiming this time that it was Miss Buckley who assaulted you before you killed her your conduct after the killing succeeded only in adding even more pain and suffering onto the Buckley family by the time of your first encounter with the police you must have been aware that her family was anxious for news of her because there had been extensive media coverage seeking information as to her whereabouts but you kept silent I question how anyone doing all of what you did over several days can seriously suggest to this court that he did so in a panic as I said at the previous hearing of this case your killing of this young woman combined with the extraordinary lengths to which you went to cover it up display the actions of a callous and calculating man you now through your counsel claim to be remorseful remorse was however only expressed for the first time when you pleaded guilty from a perusal of the criminal justice social work report it is apparent that in the course of your lengthy interviews with the social worker at no time did you ever demonstrate or express any regret for what you'd done that expression of remorse on the eleventh of August might have carried more weight if communicated earlier and it is difficult in my view to envisage someone who's truly sorry for killing another human being going to the lenghts to which you went to cover up your appaling crime whilst making up false stories about the deceased an important matter of law was raised at the Pleading Dyad in August and that was whether I'm entitled to have regard to what you did after the killing in imposing sentence on the murder charge I have been informed that when you first appeared in court you faced two charges including a second alleging an attempt to defeat the ends of justice the crown for some reason decided not to persist in seeking a conviction on that charge despite detailing in the agreed narrative the many factors which would have fully justified such a charge the Lord Advocate submitted that I would still be entitled to have regard to what you did as an aggravating factor to the murder charge and he referred me to a number of cases which he submitted supported that approach on your behalf Mister Scullion submitted that I should have no regard whatsoever to anything which occurred after the death as it was outwith the scope of the indictment I have to say that I found this an extraordinary submission standing the fact that the defence had agreed the contents of the narrative and had agreed that all of that information should be put before me I regret that the crown in withdrawing charge two has to some extent tied my hands in relation to this sentence as a result I am not able to enhance the sentence in the manner prescribed in the case of Chalmers against her Majesty's Advocate decided by a bench of five judges in two thousand and fourteen on the other hand I have never known a situation in which a judge has been invited to ignore significant material in an agreed narrative deliberately put before the court with the consent of parties after reflecting on submissions I have come to the view that I cannot ignore your conduct after the killing it has always been the position that what an accused does after a crime to conceal what he did may be an aggravating factor in two thousand and nine the Court of Appeal provided guidance in relation to sentencing in murder cases in respect of one of the accused considered the court had regard to what he had done after the murder as an aggravating factor and that was the burying of the deceased's remains which were left undiscovered for several years further aggravated by the distressing consequences to the family from a perusal of the original indictment in that case the crown had accepted a plea of not guilty to the charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice yet the Court of Appeal had regard to the conduct after the murder in selecting an appropriate sentence what you did to cover up your crime in the present case is not only such an aggravating factor it is a matter to which I can have regard in deciding what to make of your expressions of remorse and it is also a factor I consider relevant in determining what level of discount I should apply to the sentence I shall take account of what was said by our Senior Counsel in mitigation and your relative youth and I shall have regard to your early plea of guilty thus avoiding the necessity of a trial I note too that although you have a previous conviction you have no record for violence in respect of the murder charge there is only one sentence which I can impose and that is life imprisonment I require now to make an order setting what is called a punishment part and that is the minimum period of time that you will serve in prison to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence the effect of this will be that you will not be eligible for parole or release until the whole of the punishment part has expired thereafter it will be for the parole board and the parole board alone to consider whether you still present a risk to the public or whether you can be released on a life licence with appropriate conditions if you are still considered a serious risk to the public after the punsihment part has expired you will not be released I'm also required to consider a discount in this case because of your early plea in view of your conduct after the crime and the lengths to which you went to frustrate the strenuous efforts to find Miss Buckley I shall limit that discount you also told a tissue of lies about the deceased causing as I've said additional distress for her family in these circumstances I am only prepared to discount the punishment part by a period of two years the sentence will be backdated to seventeen April two thousand and fifteen when you were first remanded in custody you will therefore be sentenced to life imprisonment and in view of such a brutal senseless motiveless attack on a defenseless young woman taken together with the aggravating circumstances all as disclosed in the agreed narrative the punishment part that I would have been impo- that I would have imposed but for the discount is twenty five years I shall discount that by a period of two years the resulting punishment part is twenty three years backdated to seventeenth of April that's all
