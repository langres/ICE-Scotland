the position that as as of just now is that I- I've obviously spent time yesterday covering matters which substantially were not in the note of argument  now and that took a little bit more time erm a- and so erm erm today I I think I can probably go quite a lot faster a- and I my expectation my hope would be that I rather be finished or almost finished by the mid-morning break but we'll see how we go no promises given yes yes erm I was on the first issue erm and looking at my note of argument which at this point I think I can substantially simply follow at paragraph erm six which is page forty one in the bundle I'd been noting the authorities I'd mentioned Banks against erm Louis erm the only other case hat I erm that we have discovered that bears on issue one is which is really an encyclopaedia erm almost erm of issues under challenges to elections and I I might erm say in fact that one erm comment upon that the commissioner erm who decided erm that that that case erm has probably more experience well I'd say certainly has more experience in this field of law election partitions than anyone else in the United Kingdom erm he is the author of all the significant cases on challenges to elections erm in England erm in recent years I think with a single exception of erm Woolace erm so the th- a bi- albeit the comments that he he makes on issue one is not made erm on the be- basis of argument erm I think it's fair to take it as made on the basis of thought and consideration this comment which I've already pointed you to erm and you have seen erm is at page nine three one paragraph one oh four six twenty two in the bundle nine three one yes was just dealt with an argument that doesn't arise here erm about the erm the time erm the phrase before or during an election which has itself caused some difficulty and then at paragraph one oh four he erm he makes the issue in relation to candidates so that is the totality of judicial erm authority we have been unable to discover commentary in the texts upon this section one oh six has not received a great deal of attention erm the the texts tend to simply recite the language of subsection erm one and not take it further erm there's a limited amount of commentary not useful for today's purposes on the personal character erm issue which I won't be referring to coz it doesn't ? help there's a total absence of commentary on issue one now accordingly erm the court really has to return to first principles and to common sense the lifeblood of the law as the saying goes now we ask the question erm in the note paragraphs erm seven to erm to nine really where would be the common sense in making the two distinctions which the respondent seeks to draw the first distinction they seek to draw which they say is implicit erm is that it has to be an attacking statement second is that it has to be yep with a great respect I think the argument slightly shifted but it has to be by somebody other than the candidate or possibly by somebody other than the target there's obviously slightly different ways to formulate erm this but ermstepping back from this one has to ask where is the the point of such distinctions what sense might they make and in paragraph seven erm we make the the point that section one oh six one is totally general it applies to any person the language couldn't be wider it is  perfectly obvious that in principle a candidate is struck at how could it be said that if Mister Woolace's leaflets had not been done under his authority by his election agent but had been issued by him personally that he wouldn't be liable that there is there is no sense in making such a distinction that is probably unworkable it is clear in other words that the words any person cover Mister Carmichael it is further clear looking at the word statement that the limitation is to falsity is to falsity now false is of course a a word which has more than one possible meaning it can mean deliberately dishonest erm or it can mean simply incorrect and it's that ambiguity of meaning which is then of course explained by the act in section erm one oh six erm one erm when it gives the defence of having reasonable grounds for believing a statement to be true which shows that its meaning is simply incorrect albeit with that defence so both these concepts are entirely general now addressing then the implications of the respondent's argument in relation to the limitation they put upon falsity the words that I think featured most often yesterday was attacking which one I think can understand it it it  it's another way of looking at it is injurious which the select committee had rejected but one way or another one can understand that there's going to be on a spectrum of false statements there are going to be statements that clearly have an attacking end and there are clearly statements at the other end like the philanthropist example erm in ? whi- which are erm purely laudatory but one question that one must ask is how does one draw a line on that spectrum very commencement of of  this history the debates that were pointed to in ? we we we saw the MP for Argyle complaining about a false charge o- o- of erm poaching salmon and we see a comment erm made an answer by Mister ? who in a radical constituency he's being ? the days of the the radical party erm in a radical constituency that would have done him no harm at all would have done him good and indeed even today one would have thought that a complaint that somebody erm had been out poaching would lose them a few votes and gain them a few absolutely absolutely people are looking a- yes again fox hunting was the example in in Sunderland where erm we've we've not put the case in but it's quoted in in in Woolace there the complaint erm that was hypothesised wasn't the actual complaint in the case erm was that a candidate in a county constituency as it was put the rural constituency shot a fox even the phrasing seemed to suggest that if you if you if you said that in central Edinburgh it wouldn't be a problem at all the lovable rascal Conan Doyle erm described one of Brigadier Gerard's finest exploits as being in a a fox hunt where he galloped through the hounds and sabered the fox which he was intensely proud of the other examples we give is or is not a practising Muslim or Catholic the Catholic example historically was an absolutely central description and much of Ireland and a great deal of Scotland and some parts of England a candidate who was who made a false description of himself as Catholic in some constituencies might do so to gain votes more than he would lose them and if the c- claim was made against him vice versa is or is not a good Muslim the last general election that was a major issue was this I think within judicial knowledge in Mister Galloway's campaign in Bradford West is or is not anti-Semitic is or is not homophobic these are all things which calculation might be made is to whether more votes were to be gained or lost so there on the spectrum we have the impossibility of distinguishing laudatory and attacking I'm sorry no idea if there was a for example a a false allegation made against a candidate in in this constituency erm which I I think is Edinburgh South to any Edinburgh constituency that one of the candidates was actually a secret Muslim that's the President Obama allegation allegation erm I think we'd all be quite puzzled to know whether that gained more votes or lost or might lead I suppose polling experts' evidence we couldn't do that we just have to say the language of the statute it's a false statement and as I quote in paragraph eight as we quote the statute is not a graft upon the law of defamation even the statement in Woolace that someone was a friend of violent extremists probably have gained Mister Watkins a handful of votes and then at the laudatory end of the spectrum the substantial philanthropist we give the example and we give it more as one of fact of a r- of a true story rather than as one of law because of course the act does not apply in the state of Utah the Douglas Stringfellow story many ways poor suited as is the case of Trebitsch-Lincoln erm for a Flashman novel erm Mister Stringfellow who erm we we we see from the House of Representatives' archive the article erm erm quoted who presents this completely invented self-biography that he is a former secret agent which is why his name appears in no files parashooted into Germany to kidnap Nazi scientists imprisoned in Belsen extensively tortured which is why he then says falsely he's paraplegic wasn't even that he's walked with a limp he gets away with the story through an election with as the article quotes his intrepid tale aiding him in upsetting six term incumbent why on earth should that type of false statement not be equally penalised just as if one flipped that if his story had been true and his Democratic Party opponent had falsely claimed that it was a lie there's simply no reason to make such distinctions the second distinction which the respondent makes is whether it's by the candidate of themselves now Stringfellow's story of course was issued by himself I don't know if they have election agents in Utah whereas in Britain one almost always does but not invariably but why on earth should it make a difference the election agent is in effect authorised to give out such stories so there ? use Mister Dunlop's phrase ? two protagonists the agent who says our candidate is a heroic secret agent and the candidate of whom that is said why should it make a difference there's no sense in any of that and sometimes i- I'm sorry yes one of yes it go- it it it all re- requires the court to think about it because all of this is is is novel but in my submission it is it is a obvious on the face of the section when one does think about it now that erm ? yes yes yes Trebitsch-Lincoln is a good example  again not a story which if George MacDonald Fraser had had made it the subject of a book anyone would have thought credible but he became Liberal MP for Darlington he was a Hungarian citizen he falsely told his own party that he was a naturalised British citizen he was ineligible for election he was the only person in truth who knew that right thank you so page nine three one was that it nine three one thank you yes sory the limitation is right no no I'm just thinking about it yeah just the thought of the lovable rascal or something like that tha- it's the same thing if someone's accused of being erm either pro or anti abortion that will win  and or lose votes and the same with fox hunting that kind of thing who is to make the distinction who is to make the distinction I think you made the point in the note that the if there the one person who has an interest to make such a statement is the candidate himself and he would be the one peron who would not be open to criticism in terms of the ?
