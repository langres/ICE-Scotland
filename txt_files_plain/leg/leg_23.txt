Ms McBride is a fingerprint expert she and certain other fingerprints experts fingerprint experts who worked for the Scottish criminal records office were involved in the disputed identification of a fingerprint at the scem- of a crime at the scene of a crime as belonging to Detective Constable Shirley McKie this resulted in d- Detective Constable McKie being prosecuted for perjury and after a trial in which the accuracy of that fingerprint evidence was challenged acquitted of that charge the events created a scandal in Scotland and generated much criticism of the fingerprint service Ms McBride and the other experts involved in the disputed identification were suspended from their duties during an investigation but after the investigation rejected any malicious wrong-doing and recommended that they return to work without disciplinary action she and they resumed work erm on restricted duties in May two thousand and two they sought to return to their full duties which included signing fingerprint reports for use in court and also giving oral evidence in court but because there remained disagreement among fingerprint experts over the McKie scandal and because the prosecuting authorities did not want their evidence at trial to be undermined by cross-examination relating to the m- McGee erm Mc McKie scandal their employer did not allow them to resume those duties when the Scottish Police Services Authority was established in two thousand and seven the officer charged with its establishment made clear that he did not want the fingerprint experts who had been involved in the McKie scandal to transfer to that service he proposed that they should be redeployed when her employment was transferred to the SPSA in April two thousand and seven Ms McBride indicated that she would discuss redeployment but first she wished to discuss reinstatement to unrestricted duties this discussion did not happen and she was dismissed by her employers on first of May two thousand and seven after her internal appeal failed she succeeded in establishing in employment tribunal that she'd been unfairly dismissed that finding has not been challenged but the tribunal's order that she should be reinstated was successfully challenged on appeal the employment tribunal had ordered that Ms McBride should be reinstated to the position as fingerprint officer and treated in all respects as if she had not been dismissed but the employment appeal tribunal overturned that ruling on the ground that the employment tribunal was perverse in holding that it was practicable for the employers to comply with the order for reinstatement on Ms McBride's further appeal to the Inner House of the Court of Session the Inner House rejected the EAT's finding of perversity but held that the employment tribunal had erred in law because they had in effect ordered that Ms McBride be reemployed on altered contractual terms and that that could not be done  by an order for reinstatement Ms McBride appealed to this court in the unanimous judgement this court allows her appeal this court interprets the employment tribunal's order not as changing her contract but as recognising a practical limitation on the scope of her work because of circumstances beyond her control and also that of her employers if the prosecutors would not use her in court there was nothing that her employers could do to give her such duties we have we have erm given four reasons for our view first as the employment tribunal knew for several rea- years she had worked without being asked to sign reports or give evidence in court the reinstatement order simply returned her to that status quo secondly the employment tribunal knew that she wished to return to those duties but held that her employer's decision that she could not was reasonable thirdly the employment tribunal accepted evidence from her managers that she'd made a valuable contribution during the years in which her duties had been curtailed and fourthly on a proper construction the employment tribunal's parenthetical statement of her being reinstated and I quote to a non-court going role was an expression of their understanding of the practical context of the reinstatement and not an alteration of the terms of her employment in other words it made clear that the reinstatement did not require her employers to restore her to the duties from which she had been excluded the court also rejected an argument by the employers which had not been advanced in the tribunals or in the court below erm it did not accept that the order of reinstatement would expose the employers to a claim by Ms McBride for breach of contract for refusing to allow her to return to the excluded duties had such an argument been developed below it would have failed in face of the employers employment tribunal's findings of fact
