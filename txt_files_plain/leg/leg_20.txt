erm My Lady erm My Lords My Ladies erm as I rise to speak I know that I am erm perhaps the first counsel so far who doesn't have a title erm that's not a hint erm I'm perfectly proud and happy being an O'Neill but we have herad from two counsel erm Lord Keen and Lord Pannick who're both active parliamentarians in the House of Lords Lord Keen indeed is an active minister in the present ? government now presenting and defending government policy not only before this court but also in the House of Lords in some sense then he's acting in his own cause and we know what's said about lawyers who act in their own cause but the point I wish to make is that the quality that might be most necessary in this case for the understanding and the untangling of the issues involved there the tying up between law and politics and the constitution is a bit of distance distance lends perspective lends discernment sometimes it might lend disenchantment so what I would say in general terms is that one of the advantages which the Inner House had in this case which the divisional court did not is precisely that of distance what this means is that this court in this appeal has had the advantage of a view from the periphery what all of this heated debate political machinations looks like from four hundred miles away far from the fever and excitement of the nation's capital outside the Westminster bubble albeit as appears sometimes from some comments from press and some less informed parliamentarians that the decision is from a country which we know less and care little but distance is important we know for example that the erm constitutional court in Germany the Bundesverfassungsgericht sits not in Berlin erm nor in Frankfurt political and financial capitals but in the sleepy town of Karlsruhe because it's thought important in the structure of a constitutional court that one has that possibility of getting a sense of distance of gaining a sense of perspective from everyday politics and of course this court knows that this court goes on circuit this court sits throughout the union in Edinburgh Cardiff Belfast as well as in London the other advantages we know from distance perspective is the qualitative aspect which is played in our system by the fact that we have judgements coming from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasburg and also from the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxemburgh sometimes those judgements give us new perspectives challenge our presuppositions make us think again about what things look like from the outside gives us a chance to see ourselves as others see us though of course in many cases this court as part of its devolution jurisprudence has taken cases erm from Scotland notably in which there have been challenges made to primary legislation coming from the Scottish parliament and the interesting thing about that is first of all there is already a full constitutional judicial review in the American sense jurisprudence of this court and of the Scottish courts that they are used to dealing with challenges which look to and require evidence on and assessment of the proportionality for example of primary legislation the assessment of the rationality of policy choices erm that have been made and this court has on a number of occasions said that some legislation which has proceeded after full policy debate after a full democratic backing from a parliament in Scotland this court has said well actually looking at it dispassionately from a distance acting as a constitutional court you see that that judgement was wrong it happened of course we know in the in the named erm person's case which a a number of erm members of this court have sat as well as in legislation relating to erm sex offenders and the possibility of a defense due to lack of knowledge of a sex offender's age now those cases those two cases I mentioned in passing interestingly this court overturned the position that had been taken in the courts erm in Scotland but in this sense this case may be seen as the Inner House returning the favour which this House has prev- this court has previosuly given it is giving for this court a more dispassionate view a more distanced view a better perspective on the issues which have arisen so I commend the approach which was taken by the Inner House the judgements a careful re-reading they are measured and proper and they are at court acting to protect the constitution and ultimately that is the role of this court again ? preliminary points one thing which has arisen and I want to underline is perhaps the importance of history now as we know in England it's sometimes said the past is another country you do things differently there but sometimes in Scotland and I suspect Ireland and Wales the past isn't even past it's here and now for example erm erm when the parliament erm was prorogued by the Lord's Commissioner coming in and summoning the House of Commons erm to hear erm the reading out of the prorogation erm order erm a number of MPs stayed behind a number of the Scottish ones as I understand it started then singing Scots Wha Hae erm slightly odd you'd think singing a song about a a battle of Bannockburn thirteen fourteen penned by Robert Burns singing a song about our history written in tears and blood but the fact is it was the first thing that people reached for history is important
