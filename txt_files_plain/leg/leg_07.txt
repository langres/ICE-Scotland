David Gilroy would you stand please Suzanne Pilley was erm obviously a respected and well-liked member of staff in Thistle Street in the office in which you and she both worked in May two thousand and ten she was starting a new chapter i- in her personal life and that included bringing to an end her relationship with you on the fourth of May she set out to go to work pretty much as usual the CCTV footage showed her getting off the bus in Princess Street and after calling in to Sainsbury's making her way erm to Thistle Street then she just disappeared and the jury was satisfied on the evidence before them that that was because you murdered her and disposed of her body and it seems that you are the only person who knows where her body is I hope that the day will come in your life when you feel able to disclose that information and that might bring some comfort to her bereft family particularly her mother and father who after giving evidence sat with quiet dignity throughout the rest of the trial there are two charges remaining on the indictment on charge six the charge of murder I sentence you as I am required by law to do to life imprisonment I am also required to order that you serve a number of years as a punishment part of the sentence that is a period which must be served before you can apply for release on licence in assessing that period I require to take into account the seriousness of charge six combined with charge seven and whether you have any previous convictions I note that you have no previous convictions indeed until this sorry pass you had a responsible job and had previously done the state some service I accept that the evidence did not bear the interpretation that you lay in wait for Suzanne Pilley intending to kill her rather and this was the basis on which the crown presented its case the evidence indicated that having confronted her over her decision to end the relationship you lost your temper and murdered her in a sustained attack the evidence in support of charge seven showed that after murdering Suzanne Pilley you immediately embarked on an elaborate plan to dispose of her body and avoid detection with quite chilling calmness and calculation you set about the task you successfully disposed of the body apparently somewhere in Argyle and but for the commendably thorough investigation conducted by the Lothian and Borders Police you might well have been successful in avoiding detection and prosecution and in regard to all the circumstances I order that you serve a punishment part of eighteen years which will be backdated to thirteen March two thousand and twelve because I have combined the charges six and seven to arrive at the punishment part I make no separate order in respect to charge seven that is all would the escort take the prisoner down please
