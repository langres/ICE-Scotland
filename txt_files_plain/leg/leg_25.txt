but anyway if I just remind the court of the of the points which I wish to make is that parliamentary sovereignty is undoubtedly the animating principle of the United Kingdom constitution we know that that means or I see it clearly inherent in this concept that the Executive is subordinate to the law that's important because that basic principle seems to be being questioned at times in these febrile times and issues but that's a fundamental principle the Executive is subordinate to the Law and it is accountable to parliament so the essence of our constitution is one of accountability accountability to parliament we live in a parliamentary representative democracy so the Executive is accountable to parliament and parliament is in turn accountable to the people by way of general elections erm and members of particular constituencies the Executive in this country unlike in other countries unlike the United States is not elected directly by the people the Executive's accountability is therefore not directly to the people to claim otherwise is not to uphold our constitutional principle of representative parliamentary democracy instead claiming a direct line to the people is not democracy but populism under our constitution the Executive is accountable to answerable to has to come before and speak under questioning to the electorate representatives of the people who are duly assembled in parliament but when for example the Executive decides to have that people's PM choose by broadcasting on the web interviews and preselected questions and answers to it rather than attend for Prime Minister's Question Time before parliament that is parading and therefore undermining the true principle upon which our constitution is based which is the accountability of the Executive of ministers of the current to parliament that's what our constitution protects and embodies now against that background that the primary understanding is one of accountability by the Executive to parliament any power that the Executive has to suspend the sittings of parliament and we know that it does can only consistently and lawfully and constitutionally be exercised in a manner which is consistent with that overarching principle of accountability a power such as prorogation a unilateral executive act by the Executive closing down parliament is a derogation from that general constitutional principle of accountability as a derogation from a general principle the general principle of the Executive subordination to the Law and answerability before parliament that power has to be construed narrowly and strictly further any justification which may be offered by the Executive for the manner in which it has chosen in any particular circumstance to use that power of prorogation the derogation from the principle of accountability as Sir James says it is what it is that justification has to be looked at by the courts using what may be called anxious scrutiny precisely because parliament has no say as to when and how and for what reason and for what period the Executive might choose to close down parliament and so prevent its sitting in the present case it appears that the Prime Minister's actions in proroguing parliament has had the intent and effect of preventing parliament impeding parliament from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions that will have constitutional and irreversable impacts for our country that fundamentally alters the balance of our constitution because it's using their power to allow the Executive to govern to exercise its foreign relations power to negotiate internationally at this crucial time and all without the proper constitutional accountability to parliament that cannot be in the circumstances of this case in the manner at the time in this period be a lawful use of the power of prorogation and it's not a question of how far can you go how many weeks can I can I get away with in proroguing Lord Keene says it's not thirty five days it's only seven doesn't matter how many it is it's what its effect and intent is he previously said parliament can act incredibly swiftly ? it only took them two days to pass the erm Benn Act the two thousand and nineteen act mandating extension well if parliament can do something as monumental as that in two days just think what it could do in seven which it is now being prevented from sitting on even at Lord Keene's best calculations how much more might it do if it decided not to go into recess and sit for the full thirty five days how much more calling to account of the government would it be able then to carry out a profound amount and I've said the intent and effect this is an important point because we're not simply concerned with the subjective motivations the political calculations that might have led erm to this decision at this stage erm to prorogue parliament certainly that is useful to know as far as one can assuming one can have reliable evidence that's a matter we'll come back to but even if we all inadvertently blunder into something which results in a denial of the principle feature of accountability their ignorance of our constitution does not make what they have done lawful that is why it is what the effect is and not simply the subjective intent this court as the guardian of the constitution sees how the constitution is being affected by the use of this power looked at objectively as it happens in this case even looked at subjectively what did the Prime Minister apparently intend in using the power of prorogation at this time in this manner and for this period we say it was for an improper purpose and done in bad faith now we know there was a letter circulated when this erm all blew up on the twentieth of August two thousand nineteen but before I I turn to that I just outline again the timetable by which this case case in which I am the respondent erm came to this court this case was raised this judicial review was raised on the thirty first of July I think first orders were granted on the thirty first of July two thousand and nineteen it was raised in response to repeated leakings or unattributable briefings from well-placed Downing Street sources being used using the press as a sounding board saying something along the lines of we can prorogue parliament over exit day and that will stymy any suggestion of parliament stopping our leaving the European Union do or die come what may on this erm first of October so relying on erm the precedent in the Whiteman case which I'll be coming back to and the broader constitutional jurisdiction  in defense of the rule of law which was articulated by the first division in that case we applied for judicial review and were given permission for that on the fourth of August so long before any decision was actually taken as far as we know about the prorogation of parliament a timetable was then fixed by the court for the pleadings in the case to be adjusted on both sides and eventually a a timetable in which affidavits and other documents were specifically set to be lodged by I think that was by the thirtieth of August and then there would be a substantive hearing erm in the case I think on Friday the fifth of September or thereabouts so that was the timetable that was fixed in early August now as has become erm plain from erm the extracts from the Inner House judgement that was read out from Lord Keene pleading is an Scottish judicial reviews matter quite a lot actually erm Lord ? erm highlights this he says that in a sense there is less of a tradition of relying upon affidavits although they are perfectly competent and sometimes used in Scottish judicial reviews because one relies on the good faith of council properly instructed that they will put in their pleadings a full and candid erm disclosure of their case erm setting out erm just what erm they say their position is in this case however despite the fact that we had adjustment of pleadings up until I think the twenty eighth of August what was maintained in the pleadings by the respondent was that this case was academic and hypothetical and that there were no there was no basis for any reasonable apprehension that parliament might be prorogued in connection with attempting to make it easier to get exit day happening on the thirty first of October
