thank you very much Madam Chairman I I just want to make three very brief points because I'm here today to give you the the view of the judges erm different judges obviously have different erm points of emphasis but erm what I what I would like to convey to you is this is the general feeling of the judges on this very controversial issue erm I think there are three main points I'd like to make by way of opening the first is that erm erm in my view the abolition of the rule of corroboration erm is a matter of constitutional importance it's not simply a technical rule of the law of evidence that erm can be just changed as erm you know as as just part of a discussion of of evidence it erm in my opinion it's part of the constitution of this country and it it is one of the great legal safeguards erm in our in our s- criminal justice system that being so erm I think that if you're contemplating making a change of such profound importance erm it it should be done erm as part of a much wider erm consideration of criminal evidence and not simply done erm in an ad hoc response to one particular decision of the Supreme Court erm which is the situation in which we find ourselves here the second point I would make is that erm there is a remarkable erm degree of opposition to this erm across the entire erm legal profession erm and I'm not suggesting that that in itself is a a conclusive consideration against the abolition of corroboration please don't misunderstand me on that but what I what I do see is that where you have such a degree of opposition across the entire profession it should I think give us all pause for thought because these erm these are the views of people who have considerable experience in the practical operation of the criminal justice system and the third thing I would say is this that throughout this controversy the point has been made time and again that other countries erm can do without the rule of corroboration and erm why's Scotland out of step I think that's the wrong way to look at it I think erm in fact we should be very proud of the fact that we have something that other jurisdictions do not have erm i- it is it is one of the great hallmarks erm erm of the Sc- Scottish criminal law I take the view that we are all privileged in Scotland to live in what is a just society and the reason for that is that our criminal system is rooted in the idea of fairness and corroboration is I in my opinion a critical element in that erm so I'm I'm not here to apologise for the fact that we've got corroboration I think we we should all be very grateful that we do Madam Chairman that sh- those are really the the the three main points I'd like to make it may be that in the course of erm erm in the course of the committee's questions erm I I I may be able to suggest erm erm o- other ways out of this problem but that that is that is that is the general view of the the judiciary erm in preparation for erm the consultation response of the judges erm to the the Scottish government's erm consultation erm I asked every judge to express their view individually to me and I have to tell you that erm with the exception of erm my colleague the Lord Justice Clark all of the judges were opposed to the abolition of corroboration
