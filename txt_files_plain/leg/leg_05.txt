this is a most difficult and anxious case it is difficult to have to sit and listen to intimate details in the lives of other people and then harder still to be required to judge we trust you to recognise the truth when you hear it but also to pause if you're unsure or when you're left with a a reasonable doubt we cannot provide you with lie detectors but we trust you to recognise when something is a lie or when something is wholly incredible or unlikely and in this case I suggest to you that much of the crucial crown evidence is unreliable I don't mean to be overly critical of the advocate depute but I suggest that he's been guilty of offering assumption and accepting hindsight in his suggested approach to the case the advocate depute said at one point on the evidence there is only one person in the world who has a motive to kill Arlene Fraser I suggest that that is a dramatic overstatement if you examine the evidence I suggest you may find that what you've been offered is a feeble justification and an unconvincing motive for murder maybe Nat Fraser would end up having to pay more in the divorce than he wanted to but is that not often perhaps even usually the situation if that is a motive for murder then this country has thousands of men the police will really need to keep a close eye on we have been given a picture of Nat Fraser not caring at all not showing any interest but do you think that that's entirely fair or accurate when Nat Fraser got the call about Arlene actually being missing remember that Ian Taylor told the police I could just see Nat draining meaning the colour from his face the colour draining from your face might be something that you accept would be hard to fake to Aileen Higgins Nat Fraser appeared concerned with Constable Hall even telling us that Nat Fraser offered to call the hospital Isabel Thompson Arlene's mother told the police I told him to pull himself together what to make of that then pull yourself together don't let the kids see you like that consider for a moment ladies and gentlemen how would you prove that you didn't do something denial on its own may seem weak Nat Fraser has made his position clear I did not do those things and he goes further and says I didn't do them because I wasn't there it's the alibi which the crown accepts the crown's position is yes but so what because he planned the murder of his wife he organised it he arranged it he instructed it and where does the evidence of the plan come from entirely from Hector Dick who if he came in from outside and was soaking wet and said it was raining you'd have to put your hand out the window to check the case depends essentially on the evidence of human beings it does so where the main crown witness just supposed plan to murder is a liar if you disbelieve Hector Dick I suggest it is simple and you acquit I suggest that in any event there is certainly room for reasonable doubt proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the highest standard of proof in our courts if a jury were to think that an accused person was possibly guilty that would not be good enough and they would have to acquit even if the jury were to be satisfied that an accused person was probably guilty that would not be good enough and the jury would require to acquit murder is the most serious charge in our courts this is not a game of cludo no one appears later on with a black envelope producing a card there is no right answer but your answer words like proof beyond a reasonable doubt they're only words until they're brought to life by a jury when you consider these words along with all of the evidence in the case I suggest that what will remain at the end is a reasonable doubt and if so it is your duty to acquit I thank you very much for your attention
