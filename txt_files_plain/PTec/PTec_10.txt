Coming soon: VW Golf Alltrack

by Tom Hunter
FOR gripping golf, follow the crowds to the Ryder Cup. 
    For an even grippier Golf, make tracks for next month’s Paris Motor 
    Show, where Volkswagen will unveil its new Golf 
    Alltrack.
Blending estate-car practicality with a smattering of off-road 
    capability and foul weather surefootedness, the Alltrack justifies 
    its roughty-toughty looks with an all-wheel drive powertrain, 20mm 
    more ground clearance than a standard Golf, hill descent control 
    and adjustable throttle settings for smooth progress in slippery 
    conditions.
Engine choices are one petrol – a 176bhp turbocharged 
    1.8-litre – and three turbodiesels – a 
    108bhp 1.6-litre and a brace of 
    2.0-litre units developing 148bhp and 
    181bhp. The petrol-engined car and the most powerful diesel are 
    fitted with a six-speed paddle-shift automatic gearbox as 
    standard.
From the outside, the black protective wheel arch mouldings let 
    the world know you’re driving an Alltrack, as do the 17-inch alloy 
    wheels that are unique to this car.
Interior highlights include a leather-trimmed steering wheel and 
    gear shift lever and custom seat covers with the 
    “Alltrack” badge on the backs of the front seats.
The Alltrack is expected to go on sale in the UK next summer. 
    Paris Motor Show opens on 2 October and we expect to know UK prices 
    soon after.
