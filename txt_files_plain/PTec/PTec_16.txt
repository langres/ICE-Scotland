Citroën’s redesigned DS3 range retain its true French 
    chic

Cabrio prices start at �16,295 with 
    an 82 horsepower 1.2 three-cylinder petrol engine
Citroën’s revamp of its DS Automobiles luxury brand 
    continues with a facelift for the first of the DS models, the DS3 
    hatch and Cabrio and the introduction of a Performance 
    model.
The DS3 was launched in 2010 badged as a Citroën DS3 and got 
    instant applause for its quality. World sales are around 400,000, 
    with one in four coming to Britain – making us the biggest 
    buyer.
It is fair to say it really did lift Citroën up a rung in feel 
    and finesse while retaining the marque’s quirky, cliquey heritage. 
    Later DSA models the DS4 and DS5 have not impressed as much.
In the new DS3 range, prices start at £13,995 for the hatch in 
    Chic specification and £16,295 for the Cabrio, each with an 82 
    horsepower 1.2 three-cylinder petrol engine. Versions with sub 110g 
    C02 ratings start at £15,895 and £18,195 for the 100hp diesel in 
    hatch and Cabrio bodies. The Performance versions have a 210hp 1.6 
    petrol turbo, priced from £20,495 and £22,795 and have a 125g C02 
    rating.
Chic trim brings alloys, air conditioning and a touch screen, 
    with parking sensors and darker back windows for the Cabrio. Other 
    specs are Elegance, Prestige, Ultra Prestige and at the summit, 
    Performance Black.
My Cabrio test car was the Prestige with the BlueHDI 120hp 1.6 
    diesel, and a basic on the road price of £21,795. The powered roof 
    slides back to any position you choose, stopping when it reaches 
    the back window. Or you can keep it going, and the rear window 
    folds away as the hood stacks up on the rump of the car. It doesn’t 
    look pretty from outside but gives you lots of fresh air. It does 
    mean that the boot lid will not open – but a tug on its release 
    lever makes the hood move out of the way and the rear window fit 
    back into place. It’s a neat bit of roof engineering. The boot 
    access is always restricted. The aperture is the smallest I’ve 
    seen, a mere 11 inches high and 28 inches wide. It’s a major 
    compromise for loading large bags for Les Vacances or Le Weekly 
    Shop. The only way to get bigger stuff in the boot is by folding 
    down the seats but it’s a fuss.
Extras included the non- standard blue body paint with a black 
    roof and – most useful – a rear view camera which took most of the 
    stress out of reversing. Vision through the rear windows is not 
    brilliant and disappears completely through the back window when 
    the roof is fully open. Another vision robber is rain – and because 
    of the window mechanism a wiper cannot be fitted.
As tested, with 17-inch wheels and 205/45 tyres, there was 
    abundant road roar and plenty of bump in the suspension on poor 
    surfaces. The tyres were Michelin Sport 3 and I suppose you sign up 
    for a sporty drive. Dodgy roads caused some body 
    shudder. – a consequence of its 
    Cabrio construction. Otherwise it’s fun, fun fun. The Cabrio brings 
    out the Jacques Tati flair the French have for imaginative cars. 
    Its nominal precursor, the Citroën Pluriel, could be dismantled 
    from the top down, to leave the car fully open. The snag was that 
    you had to leave at home the bits you had removed so if the weather 
    worsened you had no protection – nor security when parked.
I’m not yet fully in accord with touch-screen controls and as 
    far as I could tell from the labyrinth of a handbook, the radio 
    on/off switch is the volume control, using steering column buttons 
    or a fiddly set of volume switches well down the dashboard.
The handbook suggested an adjacent button was the on/off switch 
    but it proved to be the call button for DS Assistance. “Don’t 
    worry, it happens all the time”, soothed the operator.
