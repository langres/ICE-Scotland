All-new Peugeot 308 is supple and classy

This Peugeot 308 may share the same number as its 
    predecessor, but it is an all-new car.
The latest 308 has shunned moving on to being the 309 as Peugeot 
    doesn’t want to hark back to its past. Instead, the new 308 is the 
    first time the French firm has continued with an existing model 
    name.
There’s nothing wrong with this when the new 308 comes based on 
    Peugeot’s clever EMP2 platform, which helps the latest 308 shed 
    140kg compared to the old model.
Losing all that weight makes the new 308 far more pleasant to 
    drive. There’s a welcome return to the supple suspension and 
    sublime ride quality that used to mark out Peugeots from their 
    mainstream rivals.
Unfortunately, Peugeot hasn’t quite managed to recapture its 
    handling know-how of 20 years ago, but the 308 deals with corners 
    in a consistent and unflustered manner.
It doesn’t enjoy the precision of a Volkswagen Golf, but the 308 
    makes light work of heavy town traffic thanks to a compact turning 
    circle and light controls.
It also has some very refined and flexible engines. The entry 
    point is a 1.2-litre petrol with 81 or 110bhp. Take the 110bhp 
    version as the lower powered motor is just too sluggish.
Better still is the nippy and quiet turbocharged 1.6-litre 
    petrol engine with 125bhp, but the best is the 1.6-litre 
    turbodiesel. It can be ordered with Peugeot’s BlueHDi technology 
    that offers incredible 91.1mpg average economy and just 82g/km 
    carbon dioxide emissions.
This is great for company drivers looking to save every penny, 
    but for other buyers the standard 1.6 diesel with 115bhp, 76.3mpg 
    and 95g/km will do a more than ample job.
With plenty of low- and mid-rev shove, this engine is ideally 
    suited to its six-speed manual gearbox and offers performance that 
    is only a sniff behind the 1.6 turbo petrol’s.
Whichever engine you prefer, the Peugeot 308’s cabin is well 
    equipped and classy thanks to a touchscreen that’s standard on all 
    but the most basic model.
Like the 208, the steering wheel seems set low and is quite 
    small. Unlike the 208, the driving position in the 308 is 
    comfortable and you can read all of the instruments easily.
There’s a large boot able to swallow up to 470-litres of 
    luggage, which leaves the VW Golf trailing.
The downside of this is the boot steals rear legroom, so taller 
    rear seat passengers will feel quite cramped. Headroom is also at a 
    premium here.
Even if these numbers don’t quite stack up, the Peugeot 308 has 
    done its sums to be a decent, though not class-leading, small hatch 
    contender.
