well it 's standing room only in here at the moment and the party has been going on since around about lunch-time 
it 's the busiest night of the year across the cities of Scotland 
with numbers in some bars and pubs and clubs 
topping those of even Hogmanay 
now a lot of work has gone into making sure the crowd stay safe tonight 
by police and the authorities 
raising a glass to the festive season 
the last Friday before Christmas is dubbed 
Black Friday 
for the sheer numbers of people swelling the city and town centres 
it 's the busiest night of the year 
and the tills are ringing 
on this Friday last year 
sales of alcohol 
were up 
one hundred and fourteen percent 
as well as extra police other precautions are being taken to keep the city centre safe 
with carefully thought-out plans in place 
authorities are hoping nothing 
dampens the festive spirit 
so I do n't think anyone here is planning on going home anytime soon but something to keep in mind for when that time 
does come 
taxis are planning to do triple the number of journeys they usually would on a Friday night 
so plan ahead 
expect long queues 
and wear something warm
