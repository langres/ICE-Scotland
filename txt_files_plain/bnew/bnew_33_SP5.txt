the Fife Diet encouraged local people to eat locally produced food 
it was the brainchild of Mike Small 
who came up with the idea as a way to reduce the number of food miles 
clocked up in the Kingdom 
and help the environment 
the project was started here in Burntisland in two thousand and seven by a couple of volunteers 
it quickly caught on 
over the years it attracted more than six thousand members 
making it the largest sustainable food project in Europe 
but it 's set to end in March 
when its current funding 
runs out 
the project has received almost a million pounds from the Scottish Government 's Climate Change Fund in recent years 
Mike insists 
the money has gone to good use 
it 's estimated that so far the project has saved more than two thousand tons of CO two emissions 
the Scottish Government say the Fife Diet delivered a number of climate action projects 
all in line with the conditions of its grant award
