views rarely seen before 
from the heights of the north tower of Inverness castle 
city councillors hope to convince colleagues that converting it into a bird 's eye vantage point for tourists 
would reap huge economic rewards 
the north tower section built as a prison has been largely redundant for decades 
the wider castle complex is currently split between the council 
and court service 
planners envisage tourist accommodation and possibly a museum or art gallery 
after 
rehousing the courts elsewhere 
business leaders 
were impressed 
things are still to be costed but there is optimism the north wing could be redeveloped by Christmas 
next year 
this vantage point was built in eighteen forty 
when the first postage stamps arrived 
Scotland 's population was half the size 
and 
Queen Victoria was about to wed Prince Albert 
soon 
tourists could be kings 
of this castle
