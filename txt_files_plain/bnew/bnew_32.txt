fully carry out their work in that case employers may need to make reasonable adjustments which could include providing bigger chairs desks and bathrooms but exactly who it will affect and how it will be applied has yet to be determined and many weight loss experts agree that personal responsibility is key in the oil and gas industry new rules next year will stop offshore workers from flying if

what's different this time around is the number of people caught drink-driving has gone down rather than up as they would usually expect and that's in spite of this new lower limit which in broad

ten percent of those who were caught were caught the morning after between six a m and ten a m and that means basically the police are targeting this time of day deliberately now what they're hoping
