Flybe will be taking to the skies above Aberdeen once again 
the airline have confirmed they 're reestablishing their base at the city 's airport a year after it was closed as part of a cost-cutting drive 
today 's announcement may be good news for Aberdeen but the aviation industry say they 're being held back from really taking off 
by the UK government tax known as air passenger duty 
at a press conference with the First Minister this morning Flybe 's boss branded it an unfair tax 
it 's a view that was repeated at a meeting of aviation bosses in Glasgow 
but it 's not just the industry complaining 
business chiefs are also opposed to the levy 
Prestwick airport was running up annual losses of two million pounds when the Scottish government took it over last year 
the First Minister blames air passenger duty for Prestwick 's woes 
there is pressure on the UK government to make the duty one of the taxes devolved to Scotland in the promised transfer of more powers 
however there was a warning that any move to scrap the tax 
would come with consequences for the coffers 
at the moment air passenger duty remains in the control of Westminster 
if it 's transferred to Holyrood 
then it will be up to Scotland whether or not to ground the tax for good
