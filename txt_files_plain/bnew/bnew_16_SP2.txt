with just over eighty days until the Referendum the Scottish Conservatives are calling on the SNP 
to come clean with the costs involved 
if the Yes campaign wins in September 
the Scots Tories submitted more than fifty parliamentary questions to the Scottish government 
demanding to know how much it will cost 
to create the one hundred and eighty bodies the SNP accepts 
are needed under separation 
it comes after warnings from Patrick Dunleavy from the London School of Economics 
that the price tag could be as high as one point five billion pounds
