it 's a problem that costs Aberdeen city council over a one hundred thousand pounds every year 
cleaning up after illegal traveller sites is a regular occurence 
and as quickly as the caravans are moved on 
they appear shortly after 
in another location 
this land was seen as a way to stop illegal sites 
with a second permanent location for travellers to use 
when they come to Aberdeen 
but now the ruling administration have dropped the plans 
after consulting with local business and residents 
this site was chosen from a shortlist of four 
as the preferred location for a new halting site 
now the Labour-led administration say they wo n't be looking at any new locations 
until they 're allowed to bring in a by-law 
that lets them move on 
illegal camp sites 
amid the political row the problem of finding a permanent site for travellers continues 
and with it 
the clear-up cost to council tax payers 
in Aberdeen
