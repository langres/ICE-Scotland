Bernard Ponsonby Bernard in Perth thank you now here's Sean with your weather and the biggest match in Europe tonight takes place right here in Glasgow as Scotland prepare to take on the Republic of Ireland in their latest Euro qualifier the judge Lord Matthews has just given Angus Sinclair his third life sentence he called him a dangerous predator capable of sinking to the depths of depravity he's ordered that he should serve thirty seven years before he can apply for parole that's a record minimum life time in Scotland and it means that Sinclair would have to live to one hundred and six before he was able to be asked to be released from jail the judge said he picked that figure deliberately our first report tonight comes from Sharon Frew on today's verdict all judges have been trying to find words that describe Angus Sinclair and his crimes but over half a century has a an appalling record and it's taken four decades to bring him to justice for the World's End murders but that's happened now thanks to DNA thanks to prosecutors and thanks to thousands of police officers who never gave up Angus Sinclair has spent more than half his life in prison but only now has the full horror of his crimes emerged a sixty nine year-old man with failing health stands convicted as a serial killer who got away with murder   for decades today's verdict means Sinclair has four confirmed victims but detectives are convinced there were at least three more Alan Jones spent fourteen years investigating the World's End murders Sinclair was just fifteen when he killed for the first time raping and strangling a little girl in his home town of Glasgow charged with murdering Catherine Rehill he was allowed to plead guilty to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility fifty three years ago the authorities knew how dangerous Angus Sinclair was and the threat he would pose in the future the judge who jailed him at these Courts called him callous wicked and cunning a psychiatrist said he showed signs of being a psychopath but in nineteen sixty eight he was released free to kill again and again Agnes Cooney Hilda McAuley Anna Kenny and Mary Gallacher were killed in Glasgow between nineteen seventy seven and nineteen seventy eight Sinclair was never a suspect police reconstructed Helen Scott's and Christine Eadie's last known movements but despite a huge enquiry Sinclair was never caught sexually motivated murders of women in the West and East of Scotland weren't linked Joe Jackson secured the confession that took Sinclair off the streets for good in nineteen eighty two he admitted raping and sexually assaulting eleven girls in Glasgow aged between three and fourteen jailed for life Sinclair has spent the last thirty two years behind bars at the start of the new century DNA was breathing new life into old cases Sinclair's genetic fingerprint was linked to seventeen year-old Mary Gallacher raped and strangled in Glasgow in nineteen seventy eight he received a second life sentence then the World's End enquiry found Sinclair's DNA on Helen Scott's cords stored carefully since nineteen seventy seven the breakthrough and their reward for never giving up this is Sinclair around that time a small man who'd kept himself fit in jail in hours of questioning by police he gave nothing away a stonewall silence the new science and old-fashioned detective work revealed Sinclair's accomplice his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton was cremated in nineteen ninety six but police chased the flat he decorated years ago and found one of his hairs and his DNA in the coving it looked like they had their man but at trial the judge threw the prosecution case out of court ruling there wasn't enough evidence for a conviction within four years the Scottish government changed the rule on double jeopardy allowing retrials if the prosecution had strong new evidence Sinclair was back in the dock the Crown presented the courts with new DNA evidence from the clothes he used to tie up the girls Helen Scott's brother was eleven when she died this is the moment he phoned her father with the result the Lord Advocates admit the families the day after the first trial collapsed and led the prosecution at the second Frank Mulholland spoke to STV news where the girls were found in East Lothian half a century ago a psychiatrist predicted Sinclair would kill again if given the chance the judge had said no young girl would be safe with him about words which echo down the years warnings which were forgotten Tom Wood led a national investigation which links Sinclair to Agnes Cooney Hilda McAuley and to Anna Kenny three more suspected victims of his killing spree from nineteen seventy seven but the forensic evidence hasn't survived Angus Sinclair had a son who was convicted of murder while serving with the army his own child has nothing to do with the man whose crimes caused such grief and misery Morain Scott has visited his daughter's grave every weekend for the last thirty seven years Helen Scott had a shopping list in her pocket when she was found she had plans for the future big and small when her father visits her this Sunday he'll know that Helen and her friend have received justice at last and their killer will never be freed well after a five-week trial the jury took two hours and twenty minutes to deliver unanimous guilty verdicts at the request of STV news cameras were allowed into the High Court to film Lord Matthews passing sentence well as you'd expect there was a great deal of emotion in the court this afternoon tears from family members hugs with police officers the Lord Advocate named eleven detectives who'd worked on the case over the thirty seven years some of them no longer alive but tonight finally what was arguably Scotland's most notorious unsolved crime has been solved and Angus Sinclair has received another life sentence which will guarantee he dies in jail back to you Angus Sinclair appeared detached and indifferent when he was taken back with the jury to the area where he dumped the girls' bodies today he showed no emotion when the guilty verdict was reached Helen Scott's and Christine Eadie's families have waited thirty seven years for this day Sinclair has been convicted of raping and strangling Helen Scott and Christine Eadie in nineteen seventy seven both were just seventeen years old the World's End murders are thought to be the oldest crime to be prosecuted in Scotland this conviction was won with twenty first century DNA analysis of the girls' clothing a determination to catch a killer that's finally given the girls' families justice Sharon Frew STV news at the High Court in Livingston these are the four men detained in dawn raids by police as part of the
