the passing of nearly four decades has left no trace of what happened here 
no flowers or tributes or scraps of police tape 
it looks like an ordinary beach on the shores of the Forth 
but it 's far from that 
this is Gosford Sands 
where Christine Eadie was found in October nineteen seventy seven 
the jury looked at the high water mark where she lay naked bound and gagged 
in the distance they could see Edinburgh 
where the two girls had been on a night out in the World 's End pub 
thirty seven years ago 
each location became the High Court for the duration of the jury 's visit 
the judge Lord Matthews had told them 
they were not to carry out their own investigations 
it was to allow them to have a look 
to get the feel of the place 
the legal teams prosecution and defence 
kept an eye on proceedings 
the accused Angus Sinclair 
stayed inside the car throughout 
the jury visited three car parks and two road junctions mentioned in the evidence 
their final stop was 
using the legal terminology 
they 'd become accustomed to 
the deposition site 
for Christine 's friend Helen Scott 
the jury has already been shown old black and white photographs of what was found here 
the half naked body of a seventeen year old girl face down 
with her hands tied behind her back 
in the peaceful rolling countryside of East Lothian 
it was a scene of degradation 
and horror 
Angus Sinclair has denied being responsible for what took place here 
thirty seven years ago 
the trial resumes in court 
tomorrow
