rivals Nicola Sturgeon's comments came at her first question session at the parliament after being officially sworn in that takes us to weather forecast now with Sean  we're all agreeing here that they can keep their snow on the other side of the Atlantic that's where we'll have to leave it for this evening I'm back with the late news from all of us here have a lovely evening bye bye she is the choice of her party and parliament so today Nicola Sturgeon's appointment was made official sworn in by a full bench of judges as Scotland's First Minister and Keeper of the Scottish Seal but before those responsibilities began there was just time for a quick selfie and then it was on to her first First Minister's questions as FM her predecessor may have answered such a question with a more bombastic tone but the new First Minister deployed a rarely used weapon consensus that desire for consensus was tested though by goading over an expected reshuffle of her cabinet she went on to defend her government's justice record but not her Justice Secretary some welcome the new First Minister's new approach others found the exchanges lacking the Salmond spark but most confidently predicted this newfound spirit of consensus won't last Claire Stewart STV news yes indeed Andrea a reshuffle of the cabinet positions and also of the junior ministerial ranks now normally when a reshuffle is in the offing you will get parliamentary aids and advisors and ministers normally those that are for the chop that will sidle up to you and give you their taking who's in and who's out there's been absolutely none of that today which tells me that she's playing this very cagely indeed people that are for the chop don't actually know it at the moment now erm given what the First Minister said yesterday on gender equality I would expect that there would be promotions for women MSPs tomorrow and the opposition as we've been hearing in that piece already think  that Kenny MacAskill is going to be removed from Justice they're saying that if that happens they would also expect a government U-turn on their policy in terms of corroboration Andrea five years ago Clare Wood was murdered at her home in Salford the man responsible was her ex-boyfriend George Appleton he had a long history of domestic violence against other women something Clare didn't know about since her death her father has campaigned for people with concerns about a partner to be able to ask the police about their history he believes that type of information would have saved her life a scheme dubbed Clare's Law will be piloted in Aberdeen and Ayrshire from next week anyone who is worried about the background of someone they're in a relationship with will be able to alert the police and if there are suitable grounds they'll be given the details  the idea is they'll then be better equipped to decide whether to stay with the person or not the system's already up and running in England and Wales it was piloted in Manchester where we're told around a hundred people have already been given information this afternoon Michael Brown met the Justice Secretary at parliament it's expected if the pilots work well Clare's Law will go Scotland-wide Gordon Chree STV news  Edinburgh well yes indeed Andrea the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in Moray on the royal train this morning they were greeted by a piper and local school children and the Lord Lieutenant of Moray before being taken here to RAF Lossiemouth where a special parade was held and the Queen unveiled a plaque to mark the station's new role as a Quick Reaction Alert base she then spent some time with family and with erm service personnel here before a flypast marked the end of their visit here and she and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled a few miles down the road to Kinloss Baracks where again they spent time with service personnel and their families before enjoying a private lunch and it was indeed a special day for the Queen and the Duke they're celebrating their sixty seventh wedding anniversary today so a memorable occasion for them and for the people of Moray well yes indeed Andrea RAF Lossiemouth is one of only two  erm RAF stations in the UK tasked with having this new role which means they're on a constant state of alert to defend the UK airspace they can have a jet in the air in ten minutes and this role was actually called erm into play just at the end of last month when two Russian jets were seen  approaching UK airspace and Typhoons from Moray went and intercepted them now these approaches are happening more regularly around a hundred in the last year three times higher than usual so the crews here at RAF Lossiemouth could be kept quite busy good evening a man has been jailed for six years

Grangemouth for uses of raw material and for energy they will have come a long way this is the sound of Grangemouth's future being built INEOS is spending four hundred billion pounds on importing shale gas from the United States the terminal will be ready by twenty sixteen but in the longer term INEOS wants to frack in its own backyard and depending on where you live in Scotland in yours too the company has two exploration licences one centred around Grangemouth covering more than three hundred square kilometres  the second around Cumbernauld covering another four hundred today in London they announced they've applied for more although they preferred not to say where this map shows the licences that are currently up for grabs INEOS says fracking could take place safely under cities towns and villages yes Andrea John Hughes has described Graeme Shinnie's agent as disrespectful and unprofessional for using the media to say the player had rejected a new Inverness deal Hughes says Clive Hart's comments have put pressure on Shinnie adding that the club are doing everything they can to keep him a free agent next summer Graeme Shinnie certainly appears to be a man in demand for the host of clubs tracking his progress it's against that backdrop Inverness have been trying to get him to commit his future to them so comments in the media from Shinnie's agent Clive Hart last week say he turned down a new deal haven't gone down well in the Highlands and Hughes insists the club aren't resigned to the fact the twenty three year-old will be leaving elsewhere Ross County captain Richard Brittain's put off an operation on a foot injury so he can help the Staggies move up the premiership table he was expected to have surgery during the international play  but that didn't happen

Barnes reports and we'll have a lot more on the rugby and of course the football tomorrow night Andrea for the weather at the moment it's a little bit mixed some showers some places some good spells of sunshine around but generally the weather fairly quiet is it going to stay quiet weather-wise over the next couple of days and into next week join me later to find out good evening well today we've seen the best of the sunshine across the Western Isles western parts of Skye and the North West Highlands lot of cloud elsewhere but first of all we want to take you to the other side of the Atlantic   the jet stream pushing way south across Canada and the Northeast states at the moment dragging in some colder air and you may have heard on the news already  the heavy snow in upstate New York but we're on the other side of the jet stream milder air here a good start to change a wee bit as we head into December it does look as if that jet stream could start to head a wee bit further south but these is the pictures coming in from upstate New York at the moment about seventy five inches of snow and places around two metres and that's actually a car buried under that snow but of course here things much much quieter and  much milder as well that's compared to the weather they're seeing now during tonight will be rather chilly expect around the Northwest Highlands could get temperatures down to around freezing and there's the risk of some mist and fog patches developing here too  elsewhere a lot of low cloud for central and eastern parts and still the risk of some showers continuing to feed in across Angus and Aberdeenshire like we've seen during today and one or two of those could still turn out to be on the heavy side  so into tomorrow again it looks as if around northern and northwestern parts that's where we'll see the best of the sunshine  the wind will be picking up through the day but for many it should be mostly dry rain pushing into the southwest later on in the evening bye bye
