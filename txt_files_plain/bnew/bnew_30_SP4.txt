in his closing speech for the prosecution the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland 
said that when Christine Eadie and Helen Scott had stepped out on a Saturday night thirty seven years ago 
little did they know what horrors would be visited upon them 
he told the Jury 
we can only imagine the terror and suffering that those girls must have felt 
but you must put aside emotions 
and assess the evidence coldly 
and dispassionately 
the Lord Advocate said Angus Sinclair was suggesting that two seventeen year-old girls who wanted to go home 
had agreed to have consensual sex with two men they 'd just met one of them twice their age 
after a conversation in a pub lasting between five and twenty five minutes 
he said Sinclair 's story 
does n't add up was ridiculous and devoid of all credibility 
his claim that his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton had raped and murdered the girls by himself 
was ludicrous 
the Lord Advocate said a magnificent piece of work by two world-class forensic scientists had provided DNA evidence against both Sinclair and Hamilton 
who died in nineteen ninety six 
he concluded 
the totality of the evidence is considerable powerful 
and quite frankly overwhelming 
it exposes as a lie the incredible story put forward by Sinclair 
for the defense Ian Duiguid QC addressed the Jury for over an hour without notes 
Mister Duiguid described the murders as brutal and merciless 
but he said the Jury must not be influenced by anything that was going on 
around this trial 
such as the daily coverage in newspapers and television 
the fact that relatives of the deceased were in court 
and that only one man was in the dock 
when two had been accused of committing the crimes 
he told the Jury 
if you do n't have credible and reliable evidence 
you ca n't convict him 
no matter what you think 
he continued 
there 's only one issue in this case 
was it two men or one man that killed them 
the evidence in this case points almost irrefutably towards Gordon Hamilton being the killer 
what you 're looking for is some kind of evidence that Angus Sinclair was there 
when the girls were killed 
and that he participated in it 
there 's just two pieces of evidence that would point you down that road 
but each is fatally flawed 
the judge will address the Jury tomorrow morning
