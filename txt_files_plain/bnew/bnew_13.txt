Lord Smith's commission has recommended that the Scottish parliament should have the power to set income tax rates and bands under the proposals Holyrood would also have control over a share of VAT as well as air passenger duty though the parliament's budget will stay the same regardless the UK government has welcomed the report but Scottish ministers say it falls short of the promises made before the referendum here's Claire Stewarts by the time they handed out the report the details had already leaked but despite party differences a deal had been struck and one which the referee of the talks claimed would deliver for Scotland so what's been agreed the big one is the recommendation that Holyrood should have the power to set its own income tax rates with the money raised staying in Scotland and a share of VAT assigned to the parliament air passenger duty should be devolved along with the power for sixteen and seventeen year-olds to vote in Holyrood elections and on welfare it's recommended the parliament gain control of a range of benefits which support the elderly carers and the disabled however the main benefit system of universal credit will remain in the control of Westminster as will state pensions the minimum wage and corporation tax along with oil and gas revenue and national insurance the Lib Dems dispute those figures you remember that front page and that vow a promise to deliver more powers for Scotland during the dying days of the referendum well did the parties today keep that promise if they're to keep to schedule the parties now have till Burns night to publish draft legislation then it will be up to whoever wins the general election to transfer Scotland's new powers to Holyrood
