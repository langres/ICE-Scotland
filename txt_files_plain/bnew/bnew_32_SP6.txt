well of course 
police are always out in force at this time of year stopping drivers 
but what 's different this time around is the number of people caught drink-driving 
has gone down rather than up as they would usually expect 
and that 's in spite of this new lower limit which in broad terms 
means it 's unsafe to even have one drink and drive 
so drivers are obviously taking heed of the warnings but police are remaining cautious about the success so far 
it 's interesting to note that ten percent of those who were caught were caught the morning after between six a m 
and ten a m 
and that means basically the police are targeting 
this time of day 
deliberately now what they 're hoping for is a change in attitude not just for the festive season 
but well into the new year 
back to you
