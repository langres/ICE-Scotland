Jenny Marra raised the issue at the Scottish parliament yesterday over a report put out this week by Healthcare Improvement Scotland 
it highlighted concerns about elderly patients waiting for long periods in the corridor on trolleys 
and in wheelchairs 
at the acute medical assessment unit at Ninewells Hospital 
though this week the organisation acknowledged progress had been made 
in addressing problems they 'd identified 
but the MSP told Alex Salmond that failure to publish the original draft of their report 
raised suspicions of a cover-up 
but NHS Tayside bosses strongly disagree with the reference to old people in corridors 
MSPs were being shown round the newly refurbished acute medical assessment unit today 
NHS Tayside say they 've been working towards big improvements before last September 's inspection 
Jenny Marra wants to ask more questions but politicians were unanimous today that the new acute unit being brought into operation is impressive
