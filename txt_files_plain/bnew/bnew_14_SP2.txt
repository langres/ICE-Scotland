Grzegorz Gamla fled more than a thousand miles to escape justice 
by then he was already hiding in Poland 
having murdered a man with whom he 'd once been good friends 
fellow Pole Maciej Ciania 
had lived in Edinburgh for ten years and regarded the city as his second home 
last January in what 's thought to have been a row over money 
Grzegorz Gamla stabbed and slashed him thirty seven times 
when Maciej 's flatmates came home 
they went to bed without realising the thirty four year-old was lying dead along the corridor 
Gamla hid his body 
in a bizzare makeshift box assembled from pieces of furniture 
it 's believed Gamla travelled from Edinburgh to Stranraer 
caught the ferry to Belfast 
then headed south to Dublin from there he flew back to Poland 
a circuitous route 
no doubt intended to cover his tracks 
police appealed for and received help from the Polish community in Edinburgh 
Gamla was chased 
extradited to Scotland and found guilty of murder 
today at the High Courts in Glasgow Grzegorz Gamla was jailed for life 
the judge Lord Pentland told him he had pressed home with ruthless determination 
a sustained and savage onslaught 
he ordered that Gamla should serve nineteen years 
before he can apply for parole 
Grzegorz Gamla will be deported 
once he 's completed his sentence
