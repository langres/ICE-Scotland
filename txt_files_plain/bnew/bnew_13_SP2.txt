by the time they handed out the report 
the details had already leaked 
but despite party differences a deal had been struck 
and one which the referee of the talks claimed 
would deliver 
for Scotland 
so what 's been agreed 
the big one is the recommendation that Holyrood should have the power to set its own income tax rates with the money raised staying in Scotland 
and a share of VAT assigned to the parliament 
air passenger duty should be devolved along with the power for sixteen and seventeen year-olds to vote in Holyrood elections 
and on welfare it 's recommended the parliament gain control of a range of benefits 
which support the elderly 
carers and the disabled 
however the main benefit system of universal credit will remain in the control of Westminster 
as will state pensions the minimum wage and corporation tax 
along with oil and gas revenue 
and national insurance 
the Lib Dems dispute those figures 
you remember that front page and that vow 
a promise to deliver more powers for Scotland during the dying days of the referendum 
well did the parties today keep that promise 
if they 're to keep to schedule the parties now have till Burns night to publish draft legislation 
then it will be up to whoever wins the general election 
to transfer Scotland 's new powers 
to Holyrood
