he 's the longest serving First Minister and the SNP 's most successful leader 
the man who helped deliver an independence Referendum 
only to see his dream shattered 
by the will 
of the majority 
today Alex Salmond faced 
his final 
First Minister 's questions 
Willie Rennie recalled what he had said 
when it was suggested he might return as SNP leader 
over a decade ago 
no trace of melancholy as he took centre stage one last time 
the mood might have been reflective 
as he thought about the previous Labour leaders he had faced 
FMQs generates more heat than light 
and is overly pugilistic 
it is however 
meat and drink to the Holyrood press pack 
who sit in judgement from 
as one hack puts it 
the cheap seats 
and with that the curtain came down 
more 
measured tributes will be paid to Alex Salmond 
next Tuesday 
do n't expect a permanent exit 
from the political stage
