when Michael Cull was knocked down by a car eleven years ago the cuts healed 
but his leg became swollen 
he was diagnosed with gross lymphedema 
a condition that causes excessive swelling 
since then despite more than twenty hospital referrals 
his limb has continued to grow 
it 's now ballooned to more than three stones in weight 
Mister Cull believes he may be suffering from elephantitis 
a disease of the Amazon where he grew up 
he was relieved when he was referred to a specialist in Hull for surgery to reduce the swelling 
but he 's now been informed that operation will not go ahead 
instead it 's recommended he undergoes treatment in Dundee 
based on compression techniques 
a much lengthier process 
everyday tasks are a major challenge for the former computer technician 
such is his desperation 
he would even consider 
an amputation 
Mister Cull believes the health system has let him down 
and prevented him from living 
a normal life 
Hull NHS Trust say it would be more clinically appropriate for Mister Cull 's care 
to be delivered in Scotland 
NHS Grampian has urged him to contact his GP
