described as the last great wilderness 
Cape Wrath is n't the easiest place to get to 
but around two thousand people a year come here on day trips 
with walkers and climbers keen to visit its Stevenson lighthouse 
but plans by the northern lighthouse board to sell off fifty eight acres of land around this iconic beacon 
have sparked the battle for Cape Wrath 
the Ministry of Defence 
owns twenty five thousand acres of the Cape and uses it for military training 
locals who run the tourist trips want to buy the land to safeguard it 
they fear purchase by the MOD would see public banned from visiting the Cape 
the Scottish government 's been asked to approve a community buy-out bid 
residents are being backed by wild land conservation charity 
the John Muir Trust 
the owner of the cafe at the lighthouse says his livelihood would be destroyed if tourists ca n't visit 
the MOD says it would like to purchase the land if a community buy-out 's not successful 
in a statement the MOD says it would n't change access from present 
but a recent letter to the area 's MP John Thurso from Junior Defence Minister Mark Francois 
says if the MOD did buy the land 
public access would be precluded
