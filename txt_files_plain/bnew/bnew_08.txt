now let 's have a look at some stories making headlines in Scotland this morning 
motorists in Scotland would prefer existing roads were repaired rather than new ones being built a survey 
by a transport campaign group suggests 
Transform Scotland said eighty four percent of a thousand and eighty six people 
said repairs were preferable 
to further construction 
seven percent disagreed 
the group quoted the most recent assessment by Audit Scotland from 
twenty eleven which put the cost 
of repairing the road network at two point two five billion pounds 
it said this was a fraction 
of the nine billion committed 
for 
new 
road building 
the survey was undertaken at 
erm 
online in May and the question asked was do you think the Scottish government should give priority 
to fixing the existing road network 
before 
building a new road 
Phil Matthews the chairman of Transform Scotland said 
the vast majority of the public wanted to prioritise repairing 
and maintaining 
existing roads 
Scotland 's existing roads cycle paths and pavements 
are in an increasingly 
poor state of repair 
markings are deteriorating pavements are damaged 
and potholes are all too common 
slowing down and 
diverting journeys 
contributing to pedestrian cycle 
and motorist accidents 
and resulting in expensive injuries 
and repair costs for travellers 
well 
nobody disagreeing with that I would n't think 
erm 
Andy Murray has appointed A- Mauresmo 
Amelie Mauresmo as a coach 
she is erm the former 
erm 
world 
number one 
lady player 
and she 's a thirty four year old is currently the France 's federation cup captain 
and will initially work with Murray 
for the grass court season 
Murray twenty seven will start the defence 
of his Queen 's Cup title this week before defending 
his Wimbledon crown 
I 'm excited by the possibilities of the new partnership 
and Amelie 
is someone I have always looked up to and admired the Scot said 
she 's faced adversity plenty of times in her career 
and 
was an amazing player 
and won major titles including Wimbledon 
I have already 
a very strong coaching team in place 
but I think 
Amelie 
brings with her experience and tactic and expertise 
and will push us all 
to improve 
so we 'll wish him well 
as the grass season 
gets underway 
now another story in the headlines today a police investigation is underway 
after a woman was raped in Glasgow city centre 
Police Scotland said that the twenty four year old victim had been attacked in the early hours 
of Sunday morning 
the assault took place in the city 's Brunswick Street 
in the Merchant City area 
a pedestrianised section of the street has been cordoned off 
while enquiries take place with further details 
on the incident are yet 
to be released
