how do you solve a problem 
like the All Blacks 
not easily 
as Vern Cotter can testify 
Scotland name the same fifteen from the defeat of Argentina 
by contrast New Zealand make thirteen changes 
with many second string players handed a chance 
do the Kiwis see the hosts as a soft target 
All Blacks may be under strength but one of Scotland 's New Zealand-born stars 
says one name alone 
ensures the world champions are taking things seriously 
the All Black selection has certainly raised eyebrows 
but you need to earn the right 
to take on the world 's elite 
Scotland feel that they 're now on the path to achieving that 
Saturday 's result 
will go a long way to showing 
just how far 
they 've still got to go
