today Annmarie White was comforted by family and friends after her daughter's killer her former boyfriend was jailed  for murder this is part of the nine nine nine call that Kevin Park made on Easter Sunday after he brutally attacked Madison in her home in Kelty just minutes before dialling nine nine nine the twenty seven year-old had already called Madison's mother who was out with friends and told her that the youngster had fallen off her bed and banged her head it was a story he repeated to the paramedics when they arrived at the family home Kevin Park had battered Madison's head over the wall with such force that forensic officers found indentations in the hallway he punched and stamped on the two year-old and prosecutors believe he may also have used a broken pool cue in the violent and sustained attack Madison died in hospital judge Michael O'Grady told Park what you have done is wicked beyond all imagining a child in your care looked to you for comfort protection and probably even love but for some reason quite beyond comprehension you inflicted upon her a callous cruel and no doubt terrifying death the judge sentenced Park to a minimum of twenty two years but he added no sentence I can impose can truly reflect the sheer awfulness of what you have done the paramedics and police officers who first attended Madison's home said Park at that time seemed detached and more

after it was closed as part of a cost-cutting drive today's announcement may be good news for Aberdeen but the aviation industry say they're being held back from really taking off by the UK government tax known as air passenger duty at a press conference with the First Minister this morning Flybe's boss branded it an unfair tax it's a view that was repeated at a meeting of aviation bosses in Glasgow but it's not just the industry complaining business chiefs are also opposed to the levy Prestwick airport was running up annual losses of two million pounds when the Scottish government took it over last year the First Minister blames air passenger duty for Prestwick's woes there is pressure on the UK government to make the duty one of the taxes devolved to Scotland in the promised transfer of more powers however there was a warning that any move to scrap the tax would come with consequences for the coffers at the moment air passenger duty remains in the control of Westminster if it's transferred to Holyrood then it will be up to Scotland whether or not to ground the tax for good Claire Stewart STV news good evening a fire has caused more than one hundred thousand pounds
