there are around four hundred cases of C diff in Scotland every year 
concerns are raised when there 's a cluster in one place at the one time and that is what happened here 
the challenge is to find out 
whether they 're linked 
fourteen people have been treated 
four of them have already been discharged 
eight are still in hospital in isolation 
so the C diff ca n't spread 
two patients who tested positive for it have died 
but they had underlying medical conditions 
and it 's understood the infection was not a factor 
in their deaths 
officials in NHS Lothian say our robust surveillance procedures meant we were able to 
identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action 
they say anyone with concerns should talk to medical or nursing staff 
who 'll be able to answer their questions 
earlier this month an official enquiry into the deaths from C diff of thirty four patients at the Vale of Leven Hospital 
in West Dunbartonshire 
blamed serious personal and systemic failures 
at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde
