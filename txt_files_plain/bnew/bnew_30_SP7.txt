today we 've been hearing from the Scotland captain Scott Brown 
and 
the manager 
good evening 
Gordon Strachan 
has dismissed any suggestions the Republic of Ireland will gain any advantage 
by playing at the home of the Scottish champions 
insisting it 'll be Scotland 's park 
not Celtic Park tomorrow night 
the visitors have been dealt a double blow with two key players ruled out through injury 
while Roy Keane has been dominating the headlines again 
following an off-the-field issue 
Sheelag MacLaren reports 
Sheelag at Celtic Park thanks very much for that 
well Ray Houghton has laughed off the sideshow of what reception 
Aiden McGeady may receive from the tartan army 
Houghton 
who was born in Glasgow but played for the Republic of Ireland as he never got a Scotland call-up 
in other football news Eddie Wolecki Black has praised his team 's 
never-say-die spirit after Glasgow City created history 
by becoming the first Scottish club to reach the quarter finals 
of the Chanpions ' League 
onto rugby news and Scotland boss Vern Cotter admits he has found it impossible to put together a plan 
to stop the All Blacks 
Cotter has kept faith with his team from last weekend 
and they will face a much changed New Zealand side 
with the world champions fielding a largely second string fifteen 
here 's Jamie Borthwick 
that 's all the sport from me tonight folks we are live from Celtic Park tomorrow night ahead of the big one 
Scotland against the Republic of Ireland
