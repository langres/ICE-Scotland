well yes indeed Andrea the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in Moray 
on the royal train this morning they were greeted by a piper and local school children 
and the Lord Lieutenant of Moray 
before being taken here 
to RAF Lossiemouth where a special parade 
was held and the Queen 
unveiled a plaque to mark the station 's new role 
as a Quick Reaction 
Alert base 
she then spent some time with family 
and with erm service personnel here before a flypast 
marked the end of their visit here 
and she and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled a few miles 
down the road 
to 
Kinloss Baracks where again they spent time 
with service personnel 
and their families before enjoying 
a private 
lunch and it was indeed a special day for the Queen 
and the Duke they 're celebrating their sixty seventh wedding anniversary today 
so a memorable occasion 
for them 
and 
for the people of Moray 
well yes indeed Andrea RAF Lossiemouth is one of only two 
erm RAF stations in the UK tasked with 
having this new role which means they 're 
on a constant state of alert 
to defend the UK airspace they can have a jet 
in the air 
in ten minutes 
and this role was actually called 
erm into play just at the end of last month when two Russian jets were seen 
approaching UK airspace 
and 
Typhoons from Moray went and intercepted them 
now these approaches are happening 
more regularly around a hundred 
in the last year three times higher than usual 
so the crews here at RAF Lossiemouth 
could be kept 
quite busy
