five years ago Clare Wood was murdered at her home in Salford 
the man responsible was her ex-boyfriend George Appleton 
he had a long history of domestic violence against other women something Clare did n't know about 
since her death her father has campaigned for people with concerns about a partner 
to be able to ask the police about their history 
he believes that type of information 
would have saved her life 
a scheme dubbed Clare 's Law will be piloted in Aberdeen and Ayrshire from next week 
anyone who is worried about the background of someone they 're in a relationship with 
will be able to alert the police and if there are suitable grounds they 'll be given the details 
the idea is they 'll then be better equipped to decide whether to stay with the person or not 
the system 's already up and running in England and Wales it was piloted in Manchester 
where we 're told around a hundred people have already been given information 
this afternoon Michael Brown met the Justice Secretary at parliament 
it 's expected if the pilots work well Clare 's Law will go Scotland-wide
