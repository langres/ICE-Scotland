when Christine Eadie and Helen Scott were murdered 
DNA profiling did n't exist 
thirty seven years on DNA evidence has taken up more than half of the World 's End trial 
Angus Sinclair 's QC Ian Duguid 
continued his cross-examination of forensic scientist Andrew Davidson 
who 'd examined the clothes used to tie up the two girls in nineteen seventy seven 
he said the clothes had been in a very good condition 
very similar to that of modern-day cases 
the jury has been told that Angus Sinclair 's DNA was found in a belt which had been tied around Helen Scott 's neck 
questioned by the defence Mister Davidson agreed 
that that DNA could have been transferred there 
by someone else 
the scientist said that was a possibility 
in any number of stains involved in this case 
Angus Sinclair has claimed that both he and his dead brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton had consensual sex with the two girls 
and that he was elsewhere when Hamilton murdered them 
questioned by the prosecution Mister Davidson agreed it was possible the DNA got on the belt from Sinclair himself 
when it was being tied around Helen 's neck 
the jury has also heard that Christine 's DNA was found in a belt tied around Helen 's wrists 
Mister Davidson agreed with the prosecution 
that it could have got there if Christine had been forced to tie up her friend 
after evidence heard over twenty days the Crown closed this case 
Mister Duguid said he needed time to take instructions from Angus Sinclair 
and the case was adjourned until tomorrow morning
