it was a day no Catholic in Scotland will forget 
the first Papal visit to this country for nearly a quarter of a century 
Pope Benedict flew into Edinburgh 
and met the Queen at Holyrood Palace 
before travelling along the M eight to Glasgow 's Bellahouston Park for an open air mass 
attended by tens of thousands of people 
among them was Rosemary Stevenson from Glasgow 
blessed by Pope Benedict that day 
as she had been by Pope John Paul 
on the previous visit in nineteen eighty two 
but it was visits like this one which have taken their toll on the eighty five year-old pontiff 
Pope Benedict is the first pontiff in modern times to resign whilst still in office 
his friend Scotland 's Cardinal Keith O'Brien said today he would pray for the Pope 's health 
and the resignation prompted shock and surprise among Catholics attending masses today 
when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope in two thousand and five 
he was seen to be from the right of the church 
with hardline views on gay marriage and women priests 
he 's popular with many 
but his critics say he has not done nearly enough to investigate allegations of money laundering by the church 
and the ongoing child abuse scandal 
well it 's a sharp winter 's afternoon here in Bellahouston Park today a far cry from those summer scenes 
of twenty ten Scotland 
will have a small role to play 
in the choosing 
of the next Pope 
Cardinal O'Brien will fly to Rome in March to take part in the conclave 
to elect Pope Benedict 's successor
