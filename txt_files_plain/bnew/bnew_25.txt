opinion the two year-old had died as a result of blunt force head and abdominal trauma the pathologist was asked about bruising which was found to both of Madison's ears doctor Penman described this as unusual and told the court that it suggested gripping or pinching of the ears the jury also heard that one of the bruises found on the youngster's face had a criss-cross pattern when asked what could have caused this doctor Penman replied perhaps the sole of a trainer the pathologist was shown two pool cues recovered from Madison's home and was asked if an object like that could have made

Sharon Frew STV news at the High Court in Glasgow yes there is a lot of coal deep under the river here and what they want to do isn't to mine it but to get the gas out of it now there's complicated science involved but in simple terms they want to use a type of controlled burning to extract that gas a process called underground coal gasification they would build a facility further up between Longannet and Grangemouth to process that gas now they say it could provide electricity for thousands of homes for many years or it be used for more industrial processes the type of things they do at the Grangemouth refinery now this is a technique that's been around for about sixty years so the question is why hasn't it been done here before when Christine Eadie and Helen Scott were murdered DNA profiling didn't exist thirty seven years on DNA evidence has taken up more than half of the World's End trial Angus Sinclair's QC Ian Duguid continued his cross-examination of forensic scientist Andrew Davidson who'd examined the clothes used to tie up the two girls in nineteen seventy seven he said the clothes had been in a very good condition very similar to that of modern-day cases the jury has been told that Angus Sinclair's DNA was found in a belt which had been tied around Helen Scott's neck questioned by the defence Mister Davidson agreed that that DNA could have been transferred there by someone else the scientist said that was a possibility in any number of stains involved in this case Angus Sinclair has claimed that both he and his dead brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton had consensual sex with the two girls and that he was elsewhere when Hamilton murdered them questioned by the prosecution Mister Davidson agreed it was possible the DNA got on the belt from Sinclair himself when it was being tied around Helen's neck the jury has also heard that Christine's DNA was found in a belt tied around Helen's wrists Mister Davidson agreed with the prosecution that it could have got there if Christine had been forced to tie up her friend after evidence heard over twenty days the Crown closed this case Mister Duguid said he needed time to take instructions from Angus Sinclair and the case was adjourned until tomorrow morning David Cowan STV news Livingston Bob Leary from Bonnyrigg in Midlothian contracted Hepatitis C from an infected blood transfusion in
