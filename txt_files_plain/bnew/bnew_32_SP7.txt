a hidden gem away from the hustle and bustle of life 
Loch Mill reservoir is a place dear to the heart of many 
a Site of Special Scientific Interest near Newburgh and Fife 
attracts walkers 
anglers 
and nature enthusiasts like Andrew Clegg 
who 's been coming here for years 
in the early twentieth century the loch was owned by the local community 
then by Fife Council 
who sold it on to Scottish Water 
for use as a reservoir 
but it 's been unused for a decade 
now up for sale 
the locals have decided 
it 's time they bought it back 
but if this beautiful spot is to come back into local ownership 
it will need support of more than fifty percent of the community 
otherwise the Scottish government 
will reject the bid 
today the local community trust had what they described as a positive meeting with government officials 
which was good news for eighty seven year-old Peter Williamson 
who 's in no doubt 
as to how he 
will vote
