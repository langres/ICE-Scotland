this eighteen century farm standing on the Cambo Estate in Fife 's East Neuk is the stuff of dreams being turned into reality 
two years ago inspired by touring golfers who could n't find a nearby whisky distillery to visit 
one time caddie Doug Clement began to look for investors 
to reach two million pounds 
that drive to convert the building into a distillery was stymied 
by the harsh economic conditions 
but 
enter the Wemyss family 
who are to invest three million pounds 
in making it happen 
the Wemyss family have been an independent whisky bottler since two thousand and five but also have business interests ranging from Kenyan tea plantations 
to Australian sheep farming 
this is the world-class Kingsbarns golf course just a mile or so from the distillery and not very far away from Saint Andrews either 
the idea is to capitalise on two of Scotland 's greatest assets 
golf 
and whisky 
the Wemyss family will produce a new and rare Lowland single malt here when conversion work is completed 
with it 's hoped up to twenty thousand visitors a year 
coming for a dram
