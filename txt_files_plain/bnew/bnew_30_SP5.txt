yes John there was a huge row over defense jobs during the Referendum campaign 
after the pro-union party said independence would mean the end of ship building in Scotland 
they said this contract for twenty six fregates would only be awarded to yards on the Clyde if the country voted No 
now in an interview the Head of the Navy 
has suggested that the Ministry of Defense may opt to buy the ships abroad citing cost as the reason 
that could mean hundreds of jobs here in the Clyde are at risk 
and it 's prompted the SNP to say voters were lied to 
in the run-up to September the eighteenth 
now the UK government has sought to make some reassurances today 
the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael 
said the Ministry of Defense did not anticipate 
any change to its policy 
of building complex warships in the UK 
but that was n't enough for the First Minister who today told MSPs at Holyrood 
that the remarks were deeply concerning 
he now plans to ? write to the Prime Minister and ask for a full explanation 
this contract is worth four billion pounds 
there is no clear date on when it will be awarded 
workers here waiting to hear if it 's them 
but if it does go abroad 
it will be the first time in peace time 
that has ever happened 
John back to you
