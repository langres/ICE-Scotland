Nicola Sturgeon will now hold the keys to the First Minister 's official residence 
but after the housewarming party 's over the new resident may find that the last tenant left her 
a pretty tough to-do list 
and at the top of that list 
will be spending cuts 
a personal priority for Nicola Sturgeon 
is inequality 
but how can she do that 
at the same time as cutting spending 
tomorrow charity chiefs will reveal hundreds of millions of pounds have been slashed from their public funding 
and it 's the most vulnerable 
who are suffering 
and then of course 
there 's independence 
forty five percent of the country backed independence 
meaning the leader of the SNP 
is no longer just the leader 
of a party 
there 's other things on the list like take seats from Labour in the twenty fifteen general election 
win the Scottish parliament elections in twenty sixteen 
and then there 's always the possibility 
of another Referendum 
the new FM 
certainly 
has a lot to do
