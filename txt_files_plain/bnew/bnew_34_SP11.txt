it has n't taken Vern Cotter long to get his message across to the Scotland squad 
but his next test has a potential to cause a few headaches 
as he prepares to face a Tonga side that caused a huge upset when the sides last met 
after two impressive performances at Murrayfield 
Cotter will take his side to Kilmarnock to round off the Autumn Tests 
it 'll be the first time the Scots have played on a synthetic surface 
he admits it presents an added challenge 
Cotter has made four changes to his starting fifteen 
Sean Maitland Mark Bennett Adam Ashe and Euan Murray 
give way for Tim Visser 
Johnnie Beattie Sean Lamont and Geoff Cross 
Visser played in that dreadful defeat to the Tongans at Pittodrie two years ago 
he 's desperate to avoid another slip-up
