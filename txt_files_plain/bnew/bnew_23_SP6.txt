it 's been a hot topic in Torry for years 
on a warm breezy day the stench from the waste water treatment plant at Nigg 
can travel for miles 
and even today 
the Torry pong 
is lingering in the air 
Torry community council have written to the environment minister 
Richard Lochhead 
asking for help 
claiming that the foul smell 
breaches their human rights 
even on a cold day in October the smell coming from this plant 
is pretty unpleasant

to remove odorous sediment 
but they say that had to be postponed 
due to the lack of an available cleaning unit 
they also say they plan to continue monitoring the situation 
while we were filming 
residents phoned the company again to complain 
and they say they 'll take their case to Holyrood 
if they have to
