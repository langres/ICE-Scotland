before the election a visit to the Royal Hospital for sick children in Edinburgh 
this visit is symbolic 
increasing health spending and more support for childcare 
are two of Nicola Sturgeon 's top policy priorities 
and then 
to parliament 
to the appointed hour 
and her session 
with destiny 
but she was not to go unchallenged 
the Scottish conservative leader Ruth Davidson forced a contest 
tokenistic yes 
but with a point to make 
the First Minister in waiting 
made a pitch which was brief 
the votes were cast followed by a five-minute adjournment to verify them 
and then the formal announcement 
Labour said her election was a symbolic one 
a significant day 
in marking the march 
of women 
in politics 
the new First Minister said she was honoured 
humbled 
would strive for consensus to forge a socially democratic socially just country 
and then a photo call with all the family 
they no doubt fit to burst with pride 
the responsibilities of the top job in Scottish politics 
now rest 
on her shoulders 
tonight 
a new era 
is under way
