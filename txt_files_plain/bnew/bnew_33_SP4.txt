yeah forget the office party the idea of being somewhere like southern Spain or the Canary Islands is pretty appealing 
erm right now and it 's those kind of destinations that some 
seventy three thousand people are gonna be passing through 
Edinburgh Airport and heading for those warmer climates over just the next 
five or six days and Edinburgh Airport says it 's likely to get through 
perhaps the ten million passenger mark for the year 
such is gonna be the busy Christmas period 
well interestingly 
there 's also gonna be almost the same not quite almost the same number 
are gonna be coming 
into Edinburgh Airport 
around sixty thousand are gonna be travelling into Edinburgh 
perhaps for the traditional Hogmanay celebrations 
or indeed 
to reunite with families for Christmas it is fair to say 
that the Christmas rush 
is certainly on 
so a hundred and thirty thousand through Edinburgh Airport over the next few days well of course it 's not just erm air travel that 's gonna be busy trains as well one operator 
reporting that it 's expecting its busiest ever 
fortnight three hundred and fifty thousand passengers crossing the border 
over the next two weeks say Virgin 
and tomorrow is gonna be their busiest day 
even today a Friday when everyone is trying to 
beat that particular rush they say ten thousand have gone south 
from Glasgow Central Station back to you
