Fired for Being Fat 
that was the headline in two thousand and nine 
when this overweight firefighter 
was dismissed from his job in Aberdeen 
but today the European Court of Justice has ruled that in certain circumstances 
obesity 
can be a disability 
which would give large workers 
greater legal protection 
according to the ruling 
obesity can amount to a disability 
if it makes it harder for an employee 
to fully carry out their work 
in that case employers may need to make reasonable adjustments 
which could include providing bigger chairs desks and bathrooms 
but exactly who it will affect 
and how it will be applied 
has yet to be determined 
and many weight loss experts agree that personal responsibility 
is key 
in the oil and gas industry 
new rules next year will stop offshore workers from flying 
if they ca n't fit through a helicopter 's emergency window 
but experts insist today 's ruling 
will have little impact on their operations
