back on Scottish soil 
Martin O'Neill and his squad arrived at their Lanarkshire base a short time ago 
with assistant manager 
Roy Keane again in the news 
this time following an incident in Dublin last night 
hardly ideal preparation ahead of the crunch clash 
no such issues for Gordon Strachan who was back on familiar territory 
for Scotland 's penultimate training session 
Strachan had many special nights in Glasgow 's East End as Celtic manager 
and while some in the opposition camp will feel at home 
he was keen to point out to come tomorrow 
the venue will be the home of Scottish football 
Scott Brown 's expected to captain the site tomorrow night and admits the venue makes the occasion extra special 
much of the build-up has centered around two Republic of Ireland players 
one of them James McCarthy has been ruled out 
through injury 
the other 
Aiden McGeady 
may receive a hot reception 
but today 
Strachan 's mind was only on the football 
and when asked about the opposition 's off-the-field issue 
Strachan quipped his week has n't gone smoothly either 
midfielder James McArthur wo n't be involved tomorrow night he 's pulled out of the squad with a calf injury 
now O'Neill also has an issue to deal with on the park the loss of James McCarthy and Glenn Whelan is a huge blow 
both were expected to start against Scotland tomorrow night 
so that means a rethink for the management team as to who plays in midfield 
now the team was due to train on the pitch at Celtic Park this evening 
but there has been a change of plan 
they trained in Dublin this morning instead 
we 'll let you know what the Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill has to say in his media conference 
on STV dot tv this evening 
back to you Raman
