they went in two by two 
a pair of representatives from each party at the first meeting of the Smith Commission 
for some the devolution road has been easier to navigate 
than others 
historically the SNP have shunned devolution talks but today they joined the other parties for the meeting over more powers for Scotland 
the Smith Commission has a lot to thrash out 
while the unionist parties share some common ground the SNP want maximum devolution 
that 's control over most powers bar foreign affairs and defense 
and Lord Smith does n't have long 
the deadline is Saint Andrew 's Day for a general agreement 
constitution experts say the time-table 
is too tight 
emerging from the talks tonight Lord Smith said the meeting had been useful 
but the parties were tight-lipped on progress 
that agreement not a comment on the Commission until talks have concluded 
may not help deal with concerns 
over a back room devo deal
