a little girl with a smile for everyone 
that was how Madison Horn 's mother described the two year-old 
today Annmarie White was comforted by family and friends 
after her daughter 's killer 
her former boyfriend 
was jailed 
for murder 
this is part of the nine nine nine call that Kevin Park made on Easter Sunday 
after he brutally attacked Madison in her home in Kelty 
just minutes before dialling nine nine nine 
the twenty seven year-old had already called Madison 's mother who was out with friends 
and told her that the youngster had fallen off her bed 
and banged her head 
it was a story he repeated to the paramedics when they arrived at the family home 
Kevin Park had battered Madison 's head over the wall with such force 
that forensic officers found indentations in the hallway 
he punched and stamped on the two year-old 
and prosecutors believe he may also have used a broken pool cue 
in the violent and sustained attack 
Madison 
died in hospital 
judge Michael O'Grady told Park 
what you have done is wicked beyond all imagining 
a child in your care looked to you for comfort protection and probably even love 
but for some reason quite beyond comprehension 
you inflicted upon her 
a callous 
cruel 
and no doubt terrifying death 
the judge sentenced Park to a minimum of twenty two years 
but he added no sentence I can impose 
can truly reflect 
the sheer awfulness 
of what you have done 
the paramedics and police officers who first attended Madison 's home 
said Park at that time seemed detached 
and more concerned with rolling a cigarette 
than the toddler 's condition 
today he showed no emotion 
as he was led away 
to begin his sentence
