she is the choice of her party 
and parliament 
so today Nicola Sturgeon 's appointment was made official 
sworn in by a full bench of judges 
as Scotland 's First Minister 
and Keeper 
of the Scottish Seal 
but before those responsibilities began there was just time for a quick selfie 
and then it was on to her first First Minister 's questions 
as FM 
her predecessor may have answered such a question with a more bombastic tone 
but the new First Minister deployed a rarely used weapon 
consensus 
that desire for consensus was tested though by goading over an expected reshuffle 
of her cabinet 
she went on to defend her government 's justice record 
but not her Justice Secretary 
some welcome the new First Minister 's new approach others found the exchanges lacking the Salmond spark 
but most confidently predicted 
this newfound spirit of consensus 
wo n't last
