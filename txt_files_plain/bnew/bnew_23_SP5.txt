in this warehouse near Glasgow and another in London the charity Scotia Aid has collected twenty tons of protective medical equipment 
it wants to send it to Sierra Leone but ca n't afford the fees for handling air freight 
which run to more than eight thousand pounds 
the Ebola outbreak has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa 
earlier this week masks and disposable aprons from the Scottish NHS began their journey to the affected area 
but Scotia Aid says it alerted the Scottish government to the need for help back in August 
the Scottish government said it received correspondence from Mister Wood yesterday 
and is unaware of any other contact 
every corner of this warehouse is piled with equipment they say could be making a difference in Sierra Leone 
there 's a clear sense of frustration that rather than being used in a West African hospital 
it 's still sitting here 
more than three thousand miles away
