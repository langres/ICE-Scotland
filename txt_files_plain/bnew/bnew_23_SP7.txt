it seems Scotland has been hitting all the right notes 
there 's been a significant rise in the number of tourists flocking to our shores 
the strongest figures 
for six years 
in the first half of twenty fourteen the number of international visitors to Scotland 
increased by sixteen percent 
the largest rise came from the US 
up 
seventy six percent 
the number of tourists from Germany 
increased by forty two percent 
and Chinese visitors spent a record 
twenty 
million pounds 
for these Texans visiting Crathes Castle today 
the figures come 
as no surprise 
business trips saw the highest growth and there were record numbers of holiday visits 
but not all in the garden is rosy 
business leaders say we must build on our recent success 
and called on the government to slash VAT on hotels and visitor attractions 
and with the latest figures not taking account of the Commonwealth Games or the Rider Cup effect 
it seems the boast that twenty fourteen would be the year that Scotland would welcome the world 
will prove true
