local services are the backbone for communities but they 're being squeezed again as council budgets are cut 
the Glasgow Association for Mental Health is facing a shortfall of forty percent 
for user Lorna Cosh it was a lifeline 
when depression left her unable to leave her home for two years 
the organisation is partly funded by Glasgow city council 
it says next year 's budget has still to be agreed and funding awards decided 
but it like all councils face making tough decisions 
Edinburgh city council has to save twenty two million pounds 
proposals include reducing the voluntary support team working with the elderly and disabled 
reducing library opening times and cutting agency staff 
East Renfreshire needs savings of twenty million over three years 
two hundred jobs are expected to go when using pupils to help run school libraries is also being considered 
Highland council needs to save twenty one million with up to a thousand staff being made redundant 
other options include reducing spending on roads 
bin collections and public toilets 
local authorities receive the majority of their funding from the Scottish government with council tax making up much of the remainder 
it 's been frozen since two thousand and seven leading to a largely party-political argument 
Labour-run councils like Glasgow say that 's putting extra pressure on services 
but SNP councils say they 're doing the best they can 
with the money they have 
councils set their budgets by February 
many are asking for suggestions on where to cut 
it seems there are no easy answers
