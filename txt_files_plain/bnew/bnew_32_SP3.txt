you 'd be forgiven for losing count of how many Labour MSPs have made the long walk on a Thursday to face the First Minister 
with Jim Murphy the new Scottish Labour leader consigned to the public gallery until he could figure out how to be an MSP 
rather than an MP 
the task of putting the tough questions to Nicola Sturgeon fell to a fresh face 
Labour 's deputy leader chose to go on the attack over oil crisis claims 
prompting a warning shot 
from the First Minister 
there were the usual cheers and jeers but how did the hacks who watch this debating spectacle every week 
think the party 's new staff performed 
Jim Murphy has attempted to hit the refresh button with a complete reshuffle of his cabinet 
the leader also wants a change of tone for the party 
so Kezia Dugdale will have to hit the right note 
during the Thursday clashes 
it 's not just the thought of Christmas which cheered up the Labour benches today a change of leadership had definitely improved the mood 
but no one 
is in any doubt 
about the challenges that lie ahead 
in twenty fifteen
