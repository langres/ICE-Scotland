construction work continues at an impressive pace at Scotland 's new concert venue on the banks of the Clyde 
it 's busy here but elsewhere the construction sector actually contracted by point four percent 
in the third quarter of last year 
overall economic activity was marginally up 
helped by growth in manufacturing and services 
but the government 's opponents are not impressed Labour want more spent on housing 
saying for every pound spent it generates another three in the wider economy 
the Conservatives accused Alex Salmond of failing to deliver on a promised five hundred million pounds construction spent 
over two years 
and the Lib Dems want more capital spending lambasting what they say is the failure 
of the Scottish Futures Trust 
the boost to the Scottish economy lagged that of the UK 
which was helped by the London Olympics 
the knock-on effect here 
appears marginal 
the outlook for the coming year is uncertain 
although business leaders believe the tourist sector 
badly hit by the Olympics in twenty twelve 
could see some positive growth 
parliament is currently scrutinising SNP spending plans 
everyone wants capital projects fast-tracked to boost construction 
that of course 
is but one sector 
of a flat economy 
this is a recovery which is certainly fragile 
we 're a long way from the kind of growth levels 
that will make a material impact on the doll queues
