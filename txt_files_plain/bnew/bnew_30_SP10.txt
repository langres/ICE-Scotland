it 's gonna stay pretty wet out there this evening the risk of some quite heavy downpours especially for the West across the Hebrides but all of that should tend to ease away 
a wee bit later on but still very very unsettled the theme in the weather 
over the next couple of days all thanks to spinning top of cloud this low pressure system 
out to the west of Ireland 
it 's got nowhere to go normally the low pressure 
would drift its way towards Scandinavia but it 's blocked here at the moment by high pressure 
blocked to the north as well by another area of high pressure so it 's got nowhere to go 
so it continues to spin 
across the Atlantic until the end of the weekend so we 'll see further spells of 
rather wet and windy weather
