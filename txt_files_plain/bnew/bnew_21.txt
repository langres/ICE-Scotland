Scotland's farmers have seen their incomes slump after last year's miserable summer ruined crops and fluctuating lifestock prices have contributed to a drop of almost twenty percent on the previous year there's a call to seek out new markets abroad but farmers say that's a struggle in the current economic climate Susan Nicholson has this now for years the archetypical image of ghillies has been that of elderly tweet-clad men roaming our hills and waterways but that could be about to change today during the official start of the salmon fishing season on the river Dee a new bursary scheme is launched to attract new blood into the industry Rachel Stewart reports well Rachel is on the banks of the river Dee for us now so Rachel how is the season looking okay Rachel many thanks for that it's

stories there's been positive news on the economic front as new figures show Scotland has officially moved out of recession and the Scottish government has announced a funding package for three hundred and seventy more teacher training places let's see what the weekend weather has in store for us now here's Sean construction work continues at an impressive pace at Scotland's new concert venue on the banks of the Clyde it's busy here but elsewhere the construction sector actually contracted by point four percent in the third quarter of last year overall economic activity was marginally up helped by growth in manufacturing and services but the government's opponents are not impressed Labour want more spent on housing saying for every pound spent it generates another three in the wider economy the Conservatives accused Alex Salmond of failing to deliver on a promised five hundred million pounds construction spent over two years and the Lib Dems want more capital spending lambasting what they say is the failure of the Scottish Futures Trust the boost to the Scottish economy lagged that of the UK which was helped by the London Olympics the knock-on effect here appears marginal the outlook for the coming year is uncertain although business leaders believe the tourist sector badly hit by the Olympics in twenty twelve could see some positive growth parliament is currently scrutinising SNP spending plans everyone wants capital projects fast-tracked to boost construction that of course is but one sector of a flat economy this is a recovery which is certainly fragile we're a long way from the kind of growth levels that will make a material impact on the doll queues Bernard Ponsonby STV news Glasgow it was playtime for these students this morning training to become a primary teacher involves learning lots of new skills next year an extra three hundred and seventy students will get the chance to take classes like this the Scottish government say it's a positive move for those looking to education as their career for graduates looking for a career in primary education these funded places will undoubtedly ease financial pressures but many students are concerned whether there'll be a full-time permanent teaching role at the end of their training job prospects for newly qualified teachers are improving despite there's a recent survey by the general teaching council found that only a third of newly qualified teachers had found a permanent job but Scotland still attracts students from all over the UK the Scottish government says it's up to local councils to find jobs for these student teachers and others like them with more young children swelling class sizes there should be opportunities for new teachers but only if the money is there to pay for them Steven McMenemy STV news well for the weekend it's looking rather chilly tomorrow slightly milder weather coming in on Sunday for a time but then we get this blast of colder air heading our way for next week with snow showers especially around the north and the west join me later for all the details feeding time for the suckler cow herd at Mains of Dumbarrow Farm in Angus beef prices are buoyant at the moment but this mixed lifestock and arable farm is still feeling the effects of last year's miserable summer figures just released by the Scottish government show a significant drop in farming income across the country the industry earned six hundred and thirty five million pounds last year that's one hundred and eleven million pounds less than in twenty eleven and when inflation is taken into account income has fallen by almost a fifth but that's a tough call as farm produce prices fluctuate on the global markets for instance the crisis in the Eurozone has seen a big drop in demand for British lamb meanwhile cheaper imports from New Zealand are at the highest level for seven years with so much lamb in the UK supply chain the price farmers receive for each animal has slumped by almost a quarter on this time last year the combination of factors hitting the industry at the moment has been described as a perfect storm it seems the best farmers can hope for this year is a decent summer to at least boost crop yields and bring some enjoyment back to the job Susan Nicholson STV news Angus good evening an MSP is insisting that questions still need to be answered about the non-delivery of a report which highlighted concerns over care for elderly patients at Ninewells Hospital Dundee-based Jenny Marra wants to ask a health watchdog why it wasn't published in its original form NHS Tayside said today that one of the main assertions in the report wasn't accurate Craig Millar reports police in Dundee say they've no fears about tomorrow's cup clash between Dundee United and Rangers thousands of supporters of the Glasgow side opted to boycott the game after bad feeling arose between the two clubs when Rangers were ejected from the SPL last season it's thought only a few hundred Rangers fans will be at Tannadice police have been monitoring social networking sites to identify any potential trouble spots now fire chiefs are praising staff at a Dundee Care Home for their quick thinking after an extractor fan caught fire the incident last night at the Tullideph Care Home led to smoke spreading along corridors and into several rooms residents were moved by staff to a safe zone in another part of the building before fire fighters attended to the blaze more than thirty nine million pounds is to be spent improving council houses in Perth and Kinross over the next five years some of the money will go towards controlled door entry systems renewing central heating and installing double glazing finally the SNP in Fife is warning that more theatres like the Byre in Saint Andrews could close if council budget cuts get the green light the SNP say the Labour-led administration plans to slash support for the new Fife cultural trust it's hoped the trust which already runs four venues in the Kingdom will reopen the Byre theatre later this year Labour says the claims are blatant scaremongering by the SNP and that's all we have time for here in the Dundee studio for tonight there's much more on our website all the latest headlines local national and international just log on to STV dot TV forward slash news celebrating the start of the salmon season on the river Dee in the traditional way even the rain put in its customary appearance as the first line was cast by guest of honour Alastair Hume he's been fishing here for seventy years and believes a new bursary scheme to attract aspiring ghillies will secure the industry's future on the river Dee ninety percent of ghillies are over fifty some are in their seventies at forty two Sean is one of the youngsters and knows all too well how difficult it is for the young pups to make their mark today on the Dee the fish wouldn't bite perhaps they're just a little camera-shy but anglers have high hopes for this season as the number of salmon caught here are at their highest levels since the nineteen eighties so with a toast to tight lines for the year ahead it's hoped this new scheme will hook the industry a brighter future well the fishery board seem reasonably confident that it's gonna be a good one they weren't willing to bite when I was out earlier but actually the last three years have seen great salmon catches on the Dee back to levels that we would have seen in the nineteen eighties thirty years ago now in part this is down to the success of the catch and release policy where anglers are encouraged to release their salmon back into the rivers and of course remember a good strong season isn't just good news for anglers it's also good for the local economy it's estimated that the sport on the Dee is worth around twelve million pounds Andrea Jenny Marra raised the issue at the Scottish parliament yesterday over a report put out this week by Healthcare Improvement Scotland it highlighted concerns about elderly patients waiting for long periods in the corridor on trolleys and in wheelchairs at the acute medical assessment unit at Ninewells Hospital though this week the organisation acknowledged progress had been made in addressing problems they'd identified but the MSP told Alex Salmond that failure to publish the original draft of their report raised suspicions of a cover-up but NHS Tayside bosses strongly disagree with the reference to old people in corridors MSPs were being shown round the newly refurbished acute medical assessment unit today NHS Tayside say they've been working towards big improvements before last September's inspection Jenny Marra wants to ask more questions but politicians were unanimous today that the new acute unit being brought into operation is impressive  Craig Millar STV news Dundee
