crooning cabbie Jimmy Smart is a singing sensation 
the fifty three year-old performs Michael Buble tunes for his passengers 
earning him the name 
Jimmy Buble 
but 
the Dundee driver can boast his own hit 
his version of You make me feel so young has received over twenty two thousand views on YouTube 
in just three days 
it 's all thanks to passenger June Picket who uploaded the video 
after she was treated to a personal concert on her journey home on Saturday night 
Jimmy who 's been driving taxis for thirty years has been floored by the attention he 's getting 
with messages coming from as far as Australia 
but he 's no plans to park the taxi 
and take to the stage 
Jimmy may not be steering a path to singing stardom 
but his passengers certainly think he 's king of the road
