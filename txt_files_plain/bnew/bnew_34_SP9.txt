in two years ' time shale gas from fracking will arrive at Grangemouth for uses of raw material and for energy 
they will have come a long way 
this is the sound 
of Grangemouth 's future 
being built 
INEOS 
is spending four hundred billion pounds 
on importing shale gas 
from the United States 
the terminal will be ready by twenty sixteen but in the longer term INEOS wants to frack in its own backyard 
and depending on where you live in Scotland 
in yours too 
the company has two exploration licences one centred around Grangemouth 
covering more than three hundred square kilometres 
the second around Cumbernauld 
covering another four hundred 
today in London they announced they 've applied for more 
although they preferred not to say where 
this map shows the licences that are currently up for grabs 
INEOS says fracking could take place safely 
under cities towns and villages
