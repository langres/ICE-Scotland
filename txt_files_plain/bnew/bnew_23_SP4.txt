as events were unfolding in Ottawa yesterday 
the Canadian National Orchestra was touching down in Scotland for a ten-day tour 
news of what was happening 
left them stunned 
their colleagues and fellow musicians at the Arts Centre were caught up 
in a security lockdown 
as police sealed off the area in a bid to capture a gunman 
who shot and killed a soldier guarding Ottawa 's War Memorial 
before running into the parliament where hundreds of MPs were gathered 
the gunman believed to be Michael Zehaf-Bibeau 
was later shot dead by sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers 
seen here 
during the attack 
he 's a close personal friend of the orchestra 's communications director 
and was today honoured for his bravery 
by the Canadian parliament 
today members of the orchestra 
performed a recital at Saint Giles Cathedral ahead of their show this evening 
it had been planned to commemorate the outbreak of the First World War 
but now it will also pay tribute to twenty four year-old Nathan Cirillo 
the soldier who lost his life yesterday 
and to the people of Ottawa 
struggling to understand what has happened 
on their doorstep 
tonight 's concert at the Usher Hall was planned to reflect 
past troubles 
but for the orchestra here the events of the last twenty four hours 
will now not be far 
from their thoughts
