it 's already killed more than four thousand people in West Africa 
and according to an expert in global health 
Ebola 
could be on its way here 
Doctor Devi Sridhar says it 's likely the deadly virus 
will hit Scotland 
and if it does 
the cases would most likely be detected in Aberdeen 
Europe 's oil capital 
a city with international connections 
but Doctor Sridhar stresses that the risk of an outbreak is very low 
she predicts a few isolated cases 
in fact one of the country 's leading authorities 
says other diseases pose a much greater risk to the thousands of Scottish oil workers 
based around the world 
but should the worst happen 
the Scottish government says the country is well prepared 
Aberdeen like several other cities 
has an established infectious diseases unit 
Aberdeen Harbour is one of the main ports in the country for trading with Africa 
tonight the risk that this unwelcome visitor will arrive in Scotland is low 
but the authorities 
remain vigilant
