it was playtime for these students this morning 
training to become a primary teacher involves learning lots of new skills 
next year an extra three hundred and seventy students will get the chance 
to take classes like this 
the Scottish government say it 's a positive move 
for those looking to education as their career 
for graduates looking for a career in primary education 
these funded places will undoubtedly ease financial pressures 
but many students are concerned 
whether there 'll be a full-time permanent teaching role 
at the end of their training 
job prospects for newly qualified teachers are improving 
despite there 's a recent survey by the general teaching council 
found that only a third of newly qualified teachers 
had found a permanent job 
but Scotland still attracts students 
from all over the UK 
the Scottish government says it 's up to local councils to find jobs for these student teachers 
and others like them 
with more young children swelling class sizes 
there should be opportunities for new teachers 
but only if the money 
is there 
to pay for them
