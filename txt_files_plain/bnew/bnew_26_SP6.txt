something big is bubbling away in a small corner of Angus 
this is Arbikie Distillery near Lunan Bay 
it 's thought to be the first in Scotland to produce its own spirits from scratch 
using potatoes from the farm 's fields staff here 
have created their own vodka 
integral to the team is Kirsty Black 
she 's one of only a small number of female master distillers 
the family has farmed here for four generations 
and now wants to break into the premium spirits market 
plans are already in place to start making gin and whisky here too 
and the distillery has the capacity to produce up to half a million litres of spirits 
a year 
the venture has created 
ten new jobs 
and if the Tattie Tipple is a success 
they could be raising a glass 
to further expansion
