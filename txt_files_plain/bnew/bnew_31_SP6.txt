it was always going to be an emotional affair 
and so it proved 
the nearly man of Scottish independence quit as SNP leader 
the day after Scotland 
said no 
in a speech which ? W B Yeats has lined about changed 
changed utterly 
Alex Salmond said 
independence 
will happen 
he said the unionist parties had used fears 
and smears to win the referendum 
saved only 
by the vow 
on more 
powers 
he acknowledged 
his era 
was at an end 
and a new one 
was about to begin 
they roared and cheered the departed leader 
a man who had cemented a legacy of taking them 
from protest movement to party of government 
once he was viewed by some 
with suspicion 
he left 
revered 
the most significant leader 
in this party 's history
