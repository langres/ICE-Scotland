Apache is one of the North Sea 's biggest producers 
earlier this year it opened a new headquarters in Aberdeen 
but as the oil price plummets close to sixty dollars a barrel 
today it 's been forced to cut contractors ' wages by ten percent 
it 's a pattern being repeated 
across the sector 
this is an industry well used to peaks and troughs 
but the plunging oil price has resulted in companies having to slash costs 
shelve projects 
and cut staff 
Shell and Chevron have announced around five hundred job losses between them in the UK 
ConocoPhillips have shed two hundred and sixty 
while BP is expected to reveal the extent of its job cuts in the North Sea 
next month 
with one leading industry figure predicting the UK sector 
is now close to collapse 
the subject 
dominated exchanges 
at First Minister 's Questions 
oil veteran Sir Ian Wood told STV news last week ten percent of the North Sea workforce could be lost 
in just eighteen months 
but could the falling oil price benefit the UK economy 
as a whole 
with no immediate sign of an increase in a barrel of crude 
analysts are predicting further dark days ahead 
for the North Sea
