for the weather at the moment it 's a little bit mixed some showers some places some good spells of sunshine around but generally the weather 
fairly quiet 
is it going to stay quiet weather-wise over the next couple of days and into next week 
join me later 
to find out 
good evening well today we 've seen the best of the sunshine across the Western Isles western parts of Skye and the North West Highlands lot of cloud elsewhere but first of all we want to take you to the other side of the Atlantic 
the jet stream pushing way south across Canada 
and the Northeast states at the moment dragging in some colder air 
and you may have heard on the news already 
the heavy snow in upstate New York 
but we 're on the other side of the jet stream milder air here 
a good start to change a wee bit as we head into December it does look as if that jet stream could start to head 
a wee bit further south but these is the 
pictures coming in from 
upstate New York at the moment about seventy five inches 
of snow and places around two metres and that 's actually a car 
buried 
under that snow but of course here 
things 
much 
much quieter and 
much milder as well 
that 's compared to the weather they 're seeing 
now during tonight will be rather chilly expect around the Northwest Highlands could get temperatures down to around freezing and there 's the risk of some mist and fog patches developing here too 
elsewhere a lot of low cloud for central and eastern parts 
and still the risk of some showers 
continuing to feed in across Angus and Aberdeenshire 
like we 've seen during today and one or two of those could still turn out to be on the heavy side 
so into tomorrow again it looks as if around northern and northwestern parts that 's where we 'll see the best of the sunshine 
the wind will be picking up through the day 
but for many it should be mostly dry 
rain pushing into the southwest 
later on in the evening 
bye bye
