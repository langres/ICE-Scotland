celebrating the start of the salmon season on the river Dee 
in the traditional way 
even the rain put in its customary appearance 
as the first line was cast by guest of honour Alastair Hume 
he 's been fishing here for seventy years 
and believes a new bursary scheme to attract aspiring ghillies 
will secure the industry 's future 
on the river Dee ninety percent of ghillies are over fifty 
some are in their seventies 
at forty two Sean is one of the youngsters 
and knows all too well how difficult it is 
for the young pups 
to make their mark 
today on the Dee the fish would n't bite 
perhaps they 're just a little camera-shy 
but anglers have high hopes for this season 
as the number of salmon caught here 
are at their highest levels 
since the nineteen eighties 
so with a toast to tight lines for the year ahead 
it 's hoped this new scheme 
will hook the industry 
a brighter future 
well the fishery board seem reasonably confident that it 's gonna be a good one 
they were n't willing to bite when I was out earlier 
but actually the last three years have seen great salmon catches on the Dee 
back to levels that we would have seen in the nineteen eighties 
thirty years ago 
now in part this is down to the success of the catch and release policy 
where anglers are encouraged to release their salmon back into the rivers 
and of course remember a good strong season 
is n't just good news for anglers 
it 's also good for the local economy 
it 's estimated that the sport on the Dee 
is worth around twelve million pounds
