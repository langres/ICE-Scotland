yes there is a lot of coal deep under the river here and what they want to do is n't to mine it 
but to get the gas out of it now there 's complicated science involved but 
in simple terms 
they want to use a type of controlled burning to extract that gas a process called 
underground coal gasification 
they would build a facility further up between Longannet and Grangemouth to process that gas now they say 
it could provide 
electricity for thousands of homes for many years 
or it be used for more industrial processes the type of things they do 
at the Grangemouth 
refinery 
now this is a technique that 's been around for about sixty years so the question is 
why has n't it been done here before
