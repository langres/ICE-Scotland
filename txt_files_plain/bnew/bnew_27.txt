Tyrone it's been a long goodbye from Alex Salmond since the drama of his resignation after Referendum defeat he's had time to think about his legacy this morning in one of his last acts as First Minister he unveiled a stone in the grounds of Herriot-Watt University etched with what he regards as his proudest policy achievement but for the man who still wears a Yes badge on his lapel it will of course be his quest for indepence which history will record today in a farewell speech to Holyrood he denied the Referendum had been a distraction and looked to the future for seven years opposition leaders have come and gone but Alex Salmond has continued to dominate this debating chamber today his opponents pay tribute with his wife Moira watching in the gallery he bid his final goodbye as First Minister she will be Scotland's new First Minister the fifth of the devolved era the first woman to hold the office Nicola Sturgeon was unchallenged for the leadership of her party testament to a career defined by an obsession with politics she is the rising star who rose the skilled debator and competent minister who now holds the hopes of a mass party in her hands it's a cold November night in Inverness and the Nicola Sturgeon roadshow arrives in the Highlands it gives her the opportunity to evangelise her message it also puts her in touch with some of the sixty thousand new SNP members impatient that the eighteenth of September represented a beginning not an end Sturgeon's politics mirror the settled posiiton of the SNP in the devolved era civic nationalist and social democratic tactically she is likely to seek to portray the unionist parties as road blocks to change but she will be cautious on the issue of a second referendum pushing forward only when convinced support for independence can get over the winning line that she became the SNP leader uncontested gives Nicola Sturgeon an authority unmatched by any previous SNP politician starting out on their leadership journey her reputation has been earned by hard work by drinking complex policy detail and eating her opponents in debate but it isn't all the eyeball of confrontation in which she has excelled fifteen years in parliament have matured her she can be laid back in company and is noticeably more at ease when conducting ministerial visits she has developed a a lighter touch less stuffy erm whispered less nippy and so a new era begins for her her party and the country opportunity laced with uncertainty as politiics plays out in a stage both exciting but utterly unpredictable Alex Salmond predicted that she would make history tonight it's impossible to say where the end game for her and the SNP will conclude views rarely seen before from the heights of the north tower of
