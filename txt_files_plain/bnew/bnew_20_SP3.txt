dramatic scenes at high tide in the Highland capital 
a huge surge saw the River Ness burst its banks 
works underway to construct a flood alleviation scheme proved futile against the river 
as temporary defences were breached by the swell 
sandbags were hastily issued to affected properties 
but the tide fell 
as quickly as it rose 
the high river providing the perfect spot for a lunchtime snack 
for a huge seal 
many residents in the Highlands had woken up to or been woken up by strong winds thunder and lightning 
fallen masonry caused early morning congestion in the Merkinch area of Inverness 
as police closed off Grant Street to clear up 
and it was an unwelcome early wake-up call for some 
more than others 
dozens of roads across the north were affected by the weather 
a huge tree strewn across the Kiltarlity Road at Belladrum stopped motorists in their tracks 
but help was on hand 
to make light work of it 
as the storm subsided throughout the day 
the attention now turns to clearing up 
but snow and sleet forecast overnight 
and into tomorrow
