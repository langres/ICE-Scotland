playing at home with Mum and Dad like any other toddler 
Caitlin is now nearly a year and a half 
but when she was born 
doctors said she might only have months to live 
Mum Marie says she ca n't thank staff at the hospital enough 
doctors quickly realised that Caitlin had a very rare heart condition and in the last year 
she 's had to undergo 
two open heart surgeries 
Steve is hoping to raise ten thousand pounds 
which could help 
thousands of sick kids 
Steve will need to run around forty three kilometres a week 
which by the end of the year would have been like running all the way from Edinburgh 
to Athens 
he says it 's a long road ahead 
Caitlin will have to continue having treatment throughout her life 
and it 's hoped that the money raised will help ensure other children like her 
get the best possible treatment
