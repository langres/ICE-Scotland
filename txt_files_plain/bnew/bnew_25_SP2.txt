Madison Horn died in hospital in the night of the twentieth of April 
the jury has heard how earlier that day 
the youngster had been left in the care of her mother 's former boyfriend 
Kevin Park denies murdering the two year-old 
today a pathologist told the High Court how Madison had sixty five injuries in total 
thirty one were to her head and neck 
doctor Don Penman said in her opinion 
the two year-old had died as a result of blunt force head and abdominal trauma 
the pathologist was asked about bruising which was found to both of Madison 's ears 
doctor Penman described this as unusual and told the court that it suggested gripping or pinching of the ears 
the jury also heard that one of the bruises found on the youngster 's face 
had a criss-cross pattern 
when asked what could have caused this doctor Penman replied 
perhaps the sole of a trainer 
the pathologist was shown two pool cues recovered from Madison 's home 
and was asked if an object like that 
could have made the marks found on Madison 's thigh 
doctor Penman told the jury 
it was a possibility 
the court heard how doctor Penman also visited Madison 's home in Kelty 
the jury has been told how the toddler 's DNA was found on indentations on the wall 
the High Court has heard that the accused has given an account of what happened 
he claims that Madison fell from her bed and banged her head 
doctor Penman says this scenario could have caused some of the youngster 's injuries 
but she said that it does n't explain them all 
the pathologist told the court that significant force would have been required to cause Madison 's skull fracture 
and other multiple injuries 
doctor Penman says she has previously seen this degree of abdominal trauma 
in children 
who have been run over 
this trial 
will continue tomorrow
