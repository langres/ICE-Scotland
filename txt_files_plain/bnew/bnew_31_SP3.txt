the judge Lord Matthews has just given Angus Sinclair 
his third 
life sentence he called him 
a dangerous predator 
capable of sinking to the depths of depravity 
he 's ordered that he should serve 
thirty seven years before he can apply for parole that 's a record 
minimum life time in Scotland 
and it means that Sinclair would have to live to one hundred and six before he was able to be 
asked to be released from jail the judge said he picked that figure 
deliberately 
our first report tonight comes from Sharon Frew 
on today 's verdict 
all judges have been trying to find words that describe 
Angus Sinclair and his crimes 
but over half a century has a 
an appalling record and it 's taken four decades 
to bring him to justice for the World 's End murders 
but that 's happened now 
thanks to DNA 
thanks to prosecutors 
and thanks to thousands of police officers 
who never gave up 
Angus Sinclair has spent more than half his life in prison 
but only now has the full horror of his crimes emerged 
a sixty nine year-old man with failing health 
stands convicted as a serial killer 
who got away with murder 
for decades 
today 's verdict means Sinclair has four confirmed victims 
but detectives are convinced 
there were at least three more 
Alan Jones spent fourteen years investigating the World 's End murders 
Sinclair was just fifteen when he killed for the first time 
raping and strangling a little girl in his home town of Glasgow 
charged with murdering Catherine Rehill 
he was allowed to plead guilty to culpable homicide 
on the grounds of diminished responsibility 
fifty three years ago the authorities knew how dangerous Angus Sinclair was and the threat he would pose in the future 
the judge who jailed him at these Courts 
called him callous wicked and cunning 
a psychiatrist said he showed signs of being a psychopath 
but in nineteen sixty eight he was released 
free 
to kill again 
and again 
Agnes Cooney Hilda McAuley Anna Kenny and Mary Gallacher were killed in Glasgow between nineteen seventy seven and nineteen seventy eight 
Sinclair was never a suspect 
police reconstructed Helen Scott 's and Christine Eadie 's last known movements 
but despite a huge enquiry Sinclair was never caught 
sexually motivated murders of women in the West and East of Scotland 
were n't linked 
Joe Jackson secured the confession that took Sinclair off the streets for good 
in nineteen eighty two he admitted raping and sexually assaulting eleven girls in Glasgow 
aged between three and fourteen 
jailed for life Sinclair has spent the last thirty two years behind bars 
at the start of the new century DNA was breathing new life into old cases 
Sinclair 's genetic fingerprint was linked to seventeen year-old Mary Gallacher 
raped and strangled in Glasgow in nineteen seventy eight 
he received a second life sentence 
then the World 's End enquiry found Sinclair 's DNA on Helen Scott 's cords stored carefully since nineteen seventy seven 
the breakthrough 
and their reward 
for never giving up 
this is Sinclair around that time 
a small man who 'd kept himself fit in jail 
in hours of questioning by police 
he gave nothing away 
a stonewall silence 
the new science and old-fashioned detective work revealed Sinclair 's accomplice 
his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton was cremated in nineteen ninety six 
but police chased the flat he decorated years ago 
and found one of his hairs 
and his DNA 
in the coving 
it looked like they had their man 
but at trial the judge threw the prosecution case out of court 
ruling there was n't enough evidence for a conviction 
within four years the Scottish government changed the rule on double jeopardy 
allowing retrials if the prosecution had strong new evidence 
Sinclair 
was back in the dock 
the Crown presented the courts with new DNA evidence 
from the clothes he used to tie up the girls 
Helen Scott 's brother 
was eleven when she died 
this is the moment he phoned her father 
with the result 
the Lord Advocates admit the families the day after the first trial collapsed 
and led the prosecution at the second 
Frank Mulholland spoke to STV news where the girls were found in East Lothian 
half a century ago a psychiatrist predicted Sinclair would kill again if given the chance 
the judge had said no young girl would be safe with him about 
words which echo down the years 
warnings 
which were forgotten 
Tom Wood led a national investigation which links Sinclair to Agnes Cooney Hilda McAuley and to Anna Kenny 
three more suspected victims 
of his killing spree from nineteen seventy seven 
but the forensic evidence has n't survived 
Angus Sinclair had a son who was convicted of murder while serving with the army 
his own child has nothing to do with the man whose crimes caused such grief and misery 
Morain Scott has visited his daughter 's grave 
every weekend for the last thirty seven years 
Helen Scott had a shopping list in her pocket when she was found 
she had plans for the future 
big 
and small 
when her father visits her this Sunday 
he 'll know that Helen and her friend have received justice at last 
and their killer 
will never be freed 
well after a 
five-week trial the jury took two hours and twenty minutes 
to deliver unanimous guilty verdicts at the request of STV news 
cameras were allowed into the High Court 
to film Lord Matthews 
passing sentence 
well as you 'd expect there was a great deal of emotion in the court this afternoon tears from family members 
hugs with police officers the Lord Advocate named eleven detectives who 'd worked on the case 
over the thirty seven years some of them 
no longer alive 
but tonight 
finally 
what was arguably Scotland 's most notorious unsolved crime 
has been solved 
and Angus Sinclair has received another life sentence which will guarantee 
he dies in jail 
back to you
