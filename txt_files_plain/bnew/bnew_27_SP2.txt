it 's been a long goodbye from Alex Salmond 
since the drama of his resignation after Referendum defeat 
he 's had time to think about his legacy 
this morning in one of his last acts as First Minister 
he unveiled a stone in the grounds of Herriot-Watt University 
etched with what he regards 
as his proudest policy achievement 
but for the man who still wears a Yes badge on his lapel 
it will of course be his quest for indepence which history 
will record 
today in a farewell speech to Holyrood he denied the Referendum had been a distraction 
and looked to the future 
for seven years opposition leaders have come and gone 
but Alex Salmond has continued to dominate this debating chamber 
today 
his opponents pay tribute 
with his wife Moira watching in the gallery 
he bid his final goodbye 
as First Minister
