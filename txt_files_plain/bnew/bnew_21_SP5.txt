feeding time for the suckler cow herd at Mains of Dumbarrow Farm in Angus 
beef prices are buoyant at the moment 
but this mixed lifestock and arable farm is still feeling the effects of last year 's miserable summer 
figures just released by the Scottish government show a significant drop in farming income 
across the country the industry earned six hundred and thirty five million pounds last year 
that 's one hundred and eleven million pounds less than in twenty eleven 
and when inflation is taken into account 
income has fallen by almost a fifth 
but that 's a tough call 
as farm produce prices fluctuate on the global markets 
for instance the crisis in the Eurozone has seen a big drop in demand for British lamb 
meanwhile cheaper imports from New Zealand are at the highest level for seven years 
with so much lamb in the UK supply chain 
the price farmers receive for each animal 
has slumped by almost a quarter 
on this time last year 
the combination of factors hitting the industry at the moment has been described as a perfect storm 
it seems the best farmers can hope for this year is a decent summer to at least boost crop yields 
and bring some enjoyment back to the job
