Angus Sinclair told the jury that he and his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton 
both had consensual sex with both of the girls 
in a dark secluded area in Holyrood Park 
Sinclair said he was thirty two 
in nineteen seventy seven 
Hamilton who died in nineteen ninety six 
was twenty two 
they 'd been in East Lothian for a fishing trip 
and had gone to the World 's End pub in Edinburgh 
the sixty nine year-old said they met Christine Eadie and Helen Scott 
slightly tipsy 
the girls accepted his offer of a lift home in his caravanette 
but instead he drove them to Arthur 's Seat 
defense QC Ian Duiguid asked him 
why did you go there 
Sinclair replied 
it seemed like a good idea at the time 
to chance my arm with the girls 
were there any objections on their part 
no 
not at all 
Angus Sinclair told the jury that after they all had sex he wanted to go back to East Lothian 
he drove all four of them there 
then went fishing 
while Hamilton took the girls back to Edinburgh 
returning two and a half hours later 
Sinclair said that later that week he saw a newspaper report 
that the girls had been found murdered 
Mister Duiguid asked 
did you ever confront Gordon Hamilton about what had happened to the girls 
he was reluctant to talk said Sinclair 
you fell out with him 
yes 
for the prosecution the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland asked Sinclair to look into his conscience and his soul 
and accept responsibility for murdering the girls 
he said to Sinclair 
the girls showed no signs of fear 
is that what you 're asking the jury to believe 
yes 
seventeen year-old girls had consensual group sex with two men 
who they had barely met 
does that sound credible to you Mister Sinclair 
no 
you appreciate it just sounds ridiculous 
yes 
your story is falling apart at the seams is it not 
no 
Mister Mulholland put it to Sinclair that the girls were seventeen 
one of them was a virgin both of them had wanted to go home 
sex clearly was n't on the minds of the two girls he said 
Sinclair replied no 
but you wanted sex did n't you 
yes 
did you enjoy their being scared Mister Sinclair 
they were n't scared 
was that part of the thrill 
their fear 
their terror 
no 
Sinclair agreed he had n't cared about the girls that they had just been something for him to use 
and that he was more concerned about Hamilton having driven his car 
than he was about him murdering them 
he did n't know how his DNA got inside knots 
on the clothes used to tie them up 
Angus Sinclair is blaming his brother-in-law for the murders 
he 'll continue his evidence tomorrow 
well clearly this was a dramatic day at this trial 
and the father of one of the victims came back to court to hear 
Angus Sinclair give his evidence 
Morain Scott who 's eighty four 
sat in the front bench in the public gallery right behind the lawyers 
as they questioned Sinclair across the courtroom 
the trial was brought to an early close today because Sinclair was yawning as he was being questioned by the Lord Advocate 
erm for the prosecution the jury has been told 
that he is suffering from a medical condition a heart condition 
and he 's on medication which is making him drowsy 
so they were sent home 
early for the day but Sinclair 
will go back into the witness box here at the High Court in Livingston 
tomorrow morning 
back to you
