today we 've seen plenty of blustery showers around some pretty heavy ones in places as well those showers will continue during tonight 
then tomorrow it should be drier for many parts before we see wet and windy weather coming back in 
on Sunday join me later for all the details 
good evening well it 's been a good old blustery day out there today plenty of heavy showers rattling through on that north-westerly to westerly airflow 
and feeling a little bit chillier today especially 
in that wind 
now I expect we 'll still hang on to plenty of showers during this evening and some of those showers will still be 
on the lively side even to lower levels so there 's a possibility of a little bit of sleet 
or perhaps even hail in the heavier showers and settling snow 
over the higher ground above around three hundred metres or so 
and here 
also see some icy patches developing 
through the night as well now still on the chilly side 
temperatures around two or three degrees Celsius but if you 're out and about perhaps at a Christmas party this evening 
that will be windy 
so it will feel 
pretty chilly 
in that wind 
so in to tomorrow we hang on to one or two showers 
during the very early part 
of the day but the good news is if you 've got all your Christmas shopping to do 
it should be mainly dry plenty of blue skies 
later on in the morning and into the afternoon so we 're looking at a 
much quieter day tomorrow 
fine 
dry with plenty of sunshine and the winds will 've eased off as well 
on the chilly side still mind you 
temperatures around four 
to six or seven degrees Celsius perhaps across East Lothian area 
eastern parts of Fife 
now the weather changes once again on Sunday the weather will turn much much milder but again it will turn windy 
there 'll be a lot of rain across western parts some of that on the heavy side here 
the rain a little bit more showery 
milder on Sunday but then colder 
towards Christmas bye-bye
