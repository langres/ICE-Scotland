yes indeed Andrea a reshuffle of the cabinet positions and also of the junior ministerial ranks now 
normally when a reshuffle is in the offing you will get 
parliamentary aids and advisors and ministers 
normally those that are for the chop that will sidle up to you 
and give you 
their taking who 's in 
and who 's out 
there 's been absolutely none of that today 
which tells me 
that she 's playing this 
very 
cagely indeed people that are for the chop 
do n't actually know it 
at the moment 
now 
erm 
given what the First Minister said yesterday on gender equality I would expect that there would be promotions 
for women 
MSPs tomorrow 
and the opposition as we 've been hearing in that piece already think 
that Kenny MacAskill is going to be removed from Justice 
they 're saying 
that if that happens they would 
also expect 
a government U-turn 
on their policy 
in terms 
of corroboration
