she will be Scotland 's new First Minister 
the fifth 
of the devolved era 
the first woman 
to hold the office 
Nicola Sturgeon was unchallenged for the leadership of her party 
testament to a career 
defined by an obsession with politics 
she 
is the rising star who rose 
the skilled debator and competent minister 
who now holds the hopes of a mass party 
in her hands 
it 's a cold November night in Inverness and the Nicola Sturgeon roadshow arrives in the Highlands 
it gives her 
the opportunity to evangelise her message 
it also puts her in touch with some of the sixty thousand new SNP members 
impatient that the eighteenth of September 
represented a beginning 
not an end 
Sturgeon 's politics mirror the settled position of the SNP in the devolved era 
civic nationalist and social democratic 
tactically she is likely to seek to portray the unionist parties 
as road blocks to change 
but she will be cautious on the issue of a second referendum 
pushing forward only when convinced 
support for independence 
can get over the winning line 
that she became the SNP leader uncontested gives Nicola Sturgeon 
an authority unmatched by any previous SNP politician 
starting out on their leadership journey 
her reputation has been earned by hard work 
by drinking complex policy detail 
and eating her opponents in debate 
but it is n't all 
the eyeball of confrontation 
in which she has excelled 
fifteen years in parliament have matured her 
she can be laid back in company 
and is noticeably more at ease when conducting ministerial visits 
she has developed a 
a lighter touch 
less stuffy 
erm 
whispered 
less nippy 
and so a new era begins for her 
her party 
and the country 
opportunity 
laced with uncertainty 
as politiics plays out in a stage 
both exciting 
but utterly unpredictable 
Alex Salmond predicted that she 
would make history 
tonight it 's impossible to say 
where the end game 
for her 
and the SNP 
will conclude
