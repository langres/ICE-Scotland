good afternoon from many parts it 's a miserable Monday out there grey and cloudy skies with outbreaks of showery rain the possibility of some heavier bursts 
coming into northwest at times and misty 
with some hill fog round here as well some brighter spells on the Murray coast 
and also for the Northern Isles but still there is ? some shorter outbreaks of rain 
but hopefully with some brightness around we could get temperatures 
around nineteen degrees for the likes of Lossiemouth 
and Kinloss 
during tonight some heavy showers across the northwest moving into the north of the mainland 
and then into Orkney a little bit later on 
with the cloud cover tonight 
and the outbreaks of rain it 's a mild one 
temperatures around eleven 
to thirteen degrees
