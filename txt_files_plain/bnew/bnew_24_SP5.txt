even at seventy seven the memory of a childhood of abuse has n't faded for Elizabeth 
mental physical 
and emotional abuse 
at the children 's home that was meant to care for her 
today at Holyrood there was a pledge to do better 
a plan to protect our children 
the government 's action plan to tackle child sexual exploitation involves a major public awareness campaign 
ensuring the likes of teachers and medical staff 
know the signs to look out for 
there was confirmation of a support fund for survivors of abuse 
but Mike Russell wo n't reach a decision on whether or not to hold a public inquiry 
until later this year 
but the delay has caused frustration for some survivors 
today 's announcement is also about protecting children 
it 's based on a report by the body Children in Scotland who say it 's not those in care 
who are sometimes most at risk 
but for survivors of abuse like Elizabeth 
the only thing that will help them now 
is the truth 
the wait for victims continues but there was a clear commitment today 
for a decision one way or the other on a public inquiry 
before Christmas
