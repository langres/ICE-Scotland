Edinburgh Council says its decision to bring in outside auditors 
is in response to calls for an independent enquiry into what happened at Mortonhall 
it 's already apologised after it emerged that parents who 'd lost stillborn or premature babies 
were told there was nothing left after the remains had been cremated 
without their knowledge ashes were buried in unmarked graves 
in a garden of rememberance 
the auditors Price Waterhouse Coopers 
will examine one hundred thousand records dating back to nineteen sixty seven when Mortonhall opened 
to two thousand and eleven 
when the practice came to an end 
the council says it 's seeking comprehensive information to help deal with the questions and concerns of families 
so far it 's had one hundred and fifty enquiries 
from parents who believe they were affected 
this afternoon the charity which brought the issue to light 
was given an update on the council 's own investigation 
the audit will take months rather than weeks over the years cremations were recorded in books in card filing systems and latterly on computers 
it 's hoped the files will reveal what 's happened to any remains 
in each individual case
