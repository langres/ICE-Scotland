midnight from all of us here have a good evening bye for now there are around four hundred cases of C diff in Scotland every year concerns are raised when there's a cluster in one place at the one time and that is what happened here the challenge is to find out whether they're linked fourteen people have been treated four of them have already been discharged eight are still in hospital in isolation so the C diff can't spread two patients who tested positive for it have died but they had underlying medical conditions and it's understood the infection was not a factor in their deaths officials in NHS Lothian say our robust surveillance procedures meant we were able to  identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action they say anyone with concerns should talk to medical or nursing staff who'll be able to answer their questions earlier this month an official enquiry into the deaths from C diff of thirty four patients at the Vale of Leven Hospital in West Dunbartonshire blamed serious personal and systemic failures  at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Gordon Chree STV News Edinburgh well it's standing room only in here at the moment and the party has been

extra police other precautions are being taken to keep the city centre safe with carefully thought-out plans in place authorities are hoping nothing dampens the festive spirit so I don't think anyone here is planning on going home anytime soon but something to keep in mind for when that time does come taxis are planning to do triple the number of journeys they usually would on a Friday night so plan ahead expect long queues and wear something warm yeah forget the office party the idea of being somewhere like southern Spain or the Canary Islands is pretty appealing  erm right now and it's those kind of destinations that some seventy three thousand people are gonna be passing through Edinburgh Airport and heading for those warmer climates over just the next five or six days and Edinburgh Airport says it's likely to get through perhaps the ten million passenger mark for the year such is gonna be the busy Christmas period well interestingly there's also gonna be almost the same not quite almost the same number are gonna be coming into Edinburgh Airport around sixty thousand are gonna be travelling into Edinburgh  perhaps for the traditional Hogmanay celebrations or indeed to reunite with families for Christmas it is fair to say that the Christmas rush is certainly on so a hundred and thirty thousand through Edinburgh Airport over the next few days well of course it's not just erm air travel that's gonna be busy trains as well one operator   reporting that it's expecting its busiest ever fortnight three hundred and fifty thousand passengers crossing the border over the next two weeks say Virgin and tomorrow is gonna be their busiest day even today a Friday when everyone is trying to beat that particular rush they say ten thousand have gone south from Glasgow Central Station back to you the Fife Diet encouraged local people to eat locally produced food it was the brainchild of Mike Small who came up with the idea as a way to reduce the number of food miles  clocked up in the Kingdom and help the environment the project was started here in Burntisland in two thousand and seven by a couple of volunteers it quickly caught on over the years it attracted more than six thousand members making it the largest sustainable food project in Europe but it's set to end in March when its current funding runs out the project has received almost a million pounds from the Scottish Government's Climate Change Fund in recent years Mike insists the money has gone to good use it's estimated that so far the project has saved more than two thousand tons of CO two emissions the Scottish Government say the Fife Diet delivered a number of climate action projects all in line with the conditions of its grant award Rebecca Curran STV News in Fife

back in on Sunday join me later for all the details good evening well it's been a good old blustery day out there today plenty of heavy showers rattling through on that north-westerly to westerly airflow  and feeling a little bit chillier today especially in that wind now I expect we'll still hang on to plenty of showers during this evening and some of those showers will still be on the lively side even to lower levels so there's a possibility of a little bit of sleet or perhaps even hail in the heavier showers and settling snow over the higher ground above around three hundred metres or so and here also see some icy patches developing through the night as well now still on the chilly side temperatures around two or three degrees Celsius but if you're out and about perhaps at a Christmas party this evening that will be windy so it will feel pretty chilly in that wind so in to tomorrow we hang on to one or two showers during the very early part of the day but the good news is if you've got all your Christmas shopping to do it should be mainly dry plenty of blue skies later on in the morning and into the afternoon so we're looking at a much quieter day tomorrow fine dry with plenty of sunshine and the winds will've eased off as well on the chilly side still mind you temperatures around four to six or seven degrees Celsius perhaps across East Lothian area eastern parts of Fife now the weather changes once again on Sunday the weather will turn much much milder but again it will turn windy there'll be a lot of rain across western parts some of that on the heavy side here the
