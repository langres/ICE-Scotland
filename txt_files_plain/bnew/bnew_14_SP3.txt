David Cameron 's speech yesterday will help shape much of the debate about Europe for years to come 
but it will also have consequences for the other parties as they have to grapple with the issue 
of voting down any move to block a referendum on renegotiated terms 
at First Minister 's Questions today Alex Salmond said he was against a referendum 
on future membership of the European Union 
this led to a sustained attack 
from the Scottish Conservative leader 
Mister Salmond said it was ironic the Conservatives thought the independence referendum was a cause of instability 
but were quite happy to trumpet a Euro poll 
which was years away 
Labour said Mister Salmond was again guilty of overstepping the mark 
with the claim 
he would be seeking talks with Commission President Barroso 
the Commission say they ca n't talk to the Scottish government about the consequences of independence 
only the UK government could facilitate such talks 
something 
Alex Salmond 
wants them to do 
tomorrow in a speech in Dublin the Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon 
will set out the economic case 
for an independent Scotland 
that comes the day after a new survey 
shows that support 
for a separate Scotland is running 
at its lowest level 
since nineteen ninety nine
