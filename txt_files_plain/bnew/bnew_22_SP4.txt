Faslane 
home to the UK 's nuclear deterrent 
and a symbol of protest politics for decades 
the UK government said today that if Scots vote for a nuclear-free independent Scotland 
it could take years to relocate Trident 
cost at least three and a half billion pounds 
and could result in massive job losses 
they were responding to a report from the Scottish Affairs Committee 
on the defence implications of independence 
the SNP say that come independence Scotland would indeed be nuclear-free 
but they argued jobs would be protected because Faslane would be needed 
as part of a conventional defence capability 
defence will be a key referendum issue 
the challenge for the SNP is to argue and advance the traditional anti-nuclear stance 
whilst persuading people that post-independence 
Scotland 's military footprint 
will not lead to widespread job losses 
their opponents will attempt to muddy the waters with difficult and complex questions 
concerning the logistics of decomissioning Faslane 
they will also argue 
that an anti-nuclear stance 
will lead 
to economic catastrophe
