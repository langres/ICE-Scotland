he took Interferon previously the standard drug for the condition

can end symptoms 
in up to ninety eight percent of cases

the sufferer 's liver can then rebuild

and it 's behind the bulk of liver transplant operations 
doctors do n't like using the term medical cure 
but sufferers will see it as just that 
Daklinza has been registered today for use by the Scottish Medicines Consortium
