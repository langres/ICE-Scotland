health inspectors made an unannounced visit to Hairmyers hospital East Kilbride in September 
of this year 
what they saw concerned them so much 
they alerted senior management 
the inspection regime included six wards and departments 
including Accident and Emergency 
and Intensive Care 
inspectors took photographs of the blood 
and bodily fluid 
that they found 
on numerous pieces of hospital equipment 
this photograph is blood 
on the underside of a patient trolley 
body fluid was found on these seated scales 
this 
is removable dirt 
on a shower floor 
and on this bedrail of a patient trolley 
there is blood contamination 
NHS Lanarkshire promised to make improvements 
but on a second unannounced visit a few weeks later 
Scotland 's chief hospital inspector was so concerned 
she reported NHS Lanarkshire to the Scottish government 
over their repeated hygiene failures 
in ward nineteen for example inspectors say they found faecal contamination 
on panels at the back of two communal toilets 
and also on the toilet wall 
they found faecal matter 
on the nurse call bell at the side of a toilet 
today NHS Lanarkshire apologised 
today the Health Secretary Alex Neil 
acknowledged the unacceptable levels of cleanliness at Hairmyers hospital 
but he said that 
health protection teams 
are now working alongside staff 
to tackle the issues raised
