surgeons on the first ever World Pancreatic Cancer Day survival rates for this disease have barely changed in the last forty years but despite the high death toll few new treatments have become available Karen Greenshields reports to sport now and more on the build-up to the Scotland match main headline Alex Salmond has used his last First Minster's Questions to praise the SNP government's record Scotland Tonight is on at ten thirty actor Alan Cummin is on the programme talking about his relationship with his abusive father following the release of his first memoir he's the longest serving First Minister and the SNP's most successful leader the man who helped deliver an independence Referendum only to see his dream shattered by the will of the majority today Alex Salmond faced his final First Minister's questions Willie Rennie recalled what he had said when it was suggested he might return as SNP leader over a decade ago no trace of melancholy as he took centre stage one last time the mood might have been reflective as he thought about the previous Labour leaders he had faced FMQs generates more heat than light and is overly pugilistic it is however meat and drink to the Holyrood press pack who sit in judgement from as one hack puts it the cheap seats and with that the curtain came down more measured tributes will be paid to Alex Salmond next Tuesday don't expect a permanent exit from the political stage for John McCabe today's developments give him the hope that more than thirty years on the truth about what happened at the Medomsley Detention Centre in county Durham may finally be known nine hundred former inmates have now contacted police claiming they were abused last year John returned with STV news to the place which haunts him aged seventeen he was sent to the Borstal for young offenders and says he was abused on a daily basis for five months an earlier investigation led to this prison officer Neville Husband being jailed but John says another man was involved and has escaped justice the Centre which closed in the eighties is now run as a secure training unit for teenagers today it was revealed police have begun interviewing former staff at Medomsley in what's become the country's biggest investigation into alleged abuse at a government-run institution of the nine hundred men who have come forward two hundred have gone on to have counselling police say those responsible will be held to account no matter the passage of time Liz Monaghan STV news in his closing speech for the prosecution the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland said that when Christine Eadie and Helen Scott had stepped out on a Saturday night thirty seven years ago little did they know what horrors would be visited upon them he told the Jury we can only imagine the terror and suffering that those girls must have felt but you must put aside emotions and assess the evidence coldly and dispassionately the Lord Advocate said Angus Sinclair was suggesting that two seventeen year-old girls who wanted to go home had agreed to have consensual sex with two men they'd just met one of them twice their age after a conversation in a pub lasting between five and twenty five minutes he said Sinclair's story doesn't add up was ridiculous and devoid of all credibility his claim that his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton had raped and murdered the girls by himself was ludicrous the Lord Advocate said a magnificent piece of work by two world-class forensic scientists had provided DNA evidence against both Sinclair and Hamilton who died in nineteen ninety six he concluded the totality of the evidence is considerable powerful and quite frankly overwhelming it exposes as a lie the incredible story put forward by Sinclair for the defense Ian Duiguid QC addressed the Jury for over an hour without notes Mister Duiguid described the murders as brutal and merciless but he said the Jury must not be influenced by anything that was going on around this trial such as the daily coverage in newspapers and television the fact that relatives of the deceased were in court and that only one man was in the dock when two had been accused of committing the crimes he told the Jury if you don't have credible and reliable evidence you can't convict him no matter what you think he continued there's only one issue in this case was it two men or one man that killed them the evidence in this case points almost irrefutably towards Gordon Hamilton being the killer what you're looking for is some kind of evidence that Angus Sinclair was there when the girls were killed and that he participated in it there's just two pieces of evidence that would point you down that road but each is fatally flawed the judge will address the Jury tomorrow morning David Cowan STV news Livingstone yes John there was a huge row over defense jobs during the Referendum campaign after the pro-union party said independence would mean the end of ship building in Scotland they said this contract for twenty six fregates would only be awarded to yards on the Clyde if the country voted No now in an interview the Head of the Navy has suggested that the Ministry of Defense may opt to buy the ships abroad citing cost as the reason that could mean hundreds of jobs here in the Clyde are at risk and it's prompted the SNP to say voters were lied to in the run-up to September the eighteenth now the UK government has sought to make some reassurances today the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said the Ministry of Defense did not anticipate any change to its policy of building complex warships in the UK but that wasn't enough for the First Minister who today told MSPs at Holyrood that the remarks were deeply concerning he now plans to ? write to the Prime Minister and ask for a full explanation this contract is worth four billion pounds there is no clear date on when it will be awarded workers here waiting to hear if it's them but if it does go abroad it will be the first time in peace time that has ever happened John back to you selling cards today to raise funds for pancreatic cancer this Greenock pensioner believes it was sheer luck that he was diagnosed early enough for treatment his doctor noticed an irregularity during a routine blood test common symptoms of pancreatic cancer include persistent indigestion upper back pain and weight loss but sadly the majority of patients are unsuitable for surgery due to late presentation the five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is the lowest of all major cancers at around three percent compare that to breast cancer five-year survival rate which stands at about eighty five percent this specialist believes survival rates could be improved if pancreatic cancer became a health priority this week the University of Glasgow was awarded almost two hundred thousand pounds to research pancreatic cancer this would have been welcome news to forty three year-old ? paramedic and ? who campaigned to raise the profile of this deadly disease Andy passed away earlier this year but his family and friends say they'll continue his work Karen Greenshields STV news back on Scottish soil Martin O'Neill and his squad arrived at their Lanarkshire base a short time ago with assistant manager Roy Keane again in the news this time following an incident in Dublin last night hardly ideal preparation ahead of the crunch clash no such issues for Gordon Strachan who was back on familiar territory for Scotland's penultimate training session Strachan had many special nights in Glasgow's East End as Celtic manager and while some in the opposition camp will feel at home he was keen to point out to come tomorrow the venue will be the home of Scottish football Scott Brown's expected to captain the site tomorrow night and admits the venue makes the occasion extra special much of the build-up has centered around two Republic of Ireland players one of them James McCarthy has been ruled out through injury the other Aiden McGeady may receive a hot reception but today Strachan's mind was only on the football and when asked about the opposition's off-the-field issue Strachan quipped his week hasn't gone smoothly either midfielder James McArthur won't be involved tomorrow night he's pulled out of the squad with a calf injury now O'Neill also has an issue to deal with on the park the loss of James McCarthy and Glenn Whelan is a huge blow both were expected to start against Scotland tomorrow night so that means a rethink for the management team as to who plays in midfield now the team was due to train on the pitch at Celtic Park this evening but there has been a change of plan they trained in Dublin this morning instead we'll let you know what the Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill has to say in his media conference on STV dot tv this evening back to you Raman how do you solve a problem like the All Blacks not easily as Vern Cotter can testify Scotland name the same fifteen from the defeat of Argentina by contrast New Zealand make thirteen changes with many second string players handed a chance do the Kiwis see the hosts as a soft target All Blacks may be under strength but one of Scotland's New Zealand-born stars says one name alone ensures the world champions are taking things seriously the All Black selection has certainly raised eyebrows but you need to earn the right to take on the world's elite Scotland feel that they're now on the path to achieving that Saturday's result will go a long way to showing just how far they've still got to go Jamie Borthwick STV news Edinburgh it's gonna stay pretty wet out there this evening the risk of some quite heavy downpours especially for the West across the Hebrides but all of that should tend to ease away a wee bit later on but still very very unsettled the theme in the weather over the next couple of days all thanks to spinning top of cloud this low pressure system out to the west of Ireland it's got nowhere to go normally the low pressure would drift its way towards Scandinavia but it's blocked here at the moment by high pressure blocked to the north as well by another area of high pressure so it's got nowhere to go so it continues to spin across the Atlantic until the end of the weekend so we'll see further spells of rather wet and windy weather today we've been hearing from the Scotland captain Scott Brown and the manager good evening Gordon Strachan has dismissed any suggestions the Republic of Ireland will gain any advantage by playing at the home of the Scottish champions insisting it'll be Scotland's park not Celtic Park tomorrow night the visitors have been dealt a double blow with two key players ruled out through injury while Roy Keane has been dominating the headlines again following an off-the-field issue Sheelag MacLaren reports Sheelag at Celtic Park thanks very much for that well Ray Houghton has laughed off the sideshow of what reception Aiden McGeady may receive from the tartan army Houghton who was born in Glasgow but played for the Republic of Ireland as he never got a Scotland call-up in other football news Eddie Wolecki Black has praised his team's never-say-die spirit after Glasgow City created history by becoming the first Scottish club to reach the quarter finals of the Chanpions' League onto rugby news and Scotland boss Vern Cotter admits he has found it impossible to put together a plan to stop the All Blacks Cotter has kept faith with his team from last weekend and they will face a much changed New Zealand side with the world champions fielding a largely second string fifteen here's Jamie Borthwick that's all the sport from me tonight folks we are live from Celtic Park tomorrow night ahead of the big one Scotland against the Republic of Ireland John
