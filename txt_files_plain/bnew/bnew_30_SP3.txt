for John McCabe today 's developments give him the hope 
that more than thirty years on 
the truth about what happened at the Medomsley Detention Centre in county Durham 
may finally be known 
nine hundred former inmates have now contacted police 
claiming they were abused 
last year John returned with STV news to the place which haunts him 
aged seventeen he was sent to the Borstal for young offenders 
and says he was abused on a daily basis for five months 
an earlier investigation led to this prison officer Neville Husband being jailed 
but John says another man was involved 
and has escaped justice 
the Centre which closed in the eighties is now run as a secure training unit 
for teenagers 
today it was revealed police have begun interviewing 
former staff at Medomsley 
in what 's become the country 's biggest investigation 
into alleged abuse at a government-run institution 
of the nine hundred men who have come forward 
two hundred have gone on to have counselling 
police say 
those responsible will be held to account 
no matter the passage of time
