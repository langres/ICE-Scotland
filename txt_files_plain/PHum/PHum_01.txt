Scots place names explained by Glasgow Uni 
    experts

RESEARCHERS at the University of Glasgow have 
    developed a new online learning tool to help the nation’s school 
    pupils to learn the stories of the names of their 
    communities.
Scotland’s Place Names is designed to teach late primary and 
    early secondary pupils the history, etymology and linguistics 
    behind the names of locations across Scotland.
The project draws on the work of the University’s Scottish 
    Toponymy in Transition (STIT) project into Scotland’s place 
    names.
Dr Simon Taylor, Chief Researcher of the STIT Project, said: 
    “Scotland is a country where many different languages have 
    been spoken over the last 1,500 years, and its place-names reflect 
    this rich and varied history.
“We are pleased to be working with Education Scotland on 
    such a unique project and we hope that it will encourage young 
    people to learn more about the different languages and peoples that 
    have created the modern namescape, and to appreciate the rich 
    cultural legacy embodied in their place-names.”
Scotland’s Place Names was developed by the University of 
    Glasgow alongside Education Scotland, and sits alongside the 
    ‘Studying Scotland’ series of teaching aids which focuses on the 
    changing face of Scottish national identity.
The STIT Project is producing detailed works on 
    Clackmannanshire, Kinross-shire, and Menteith and the Trossachs. A 
    previous project at the University of Glasgow completed a 
    five-volume series entitled The Place-Names of Fife.
