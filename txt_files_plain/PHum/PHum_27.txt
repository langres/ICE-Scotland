Scots fails to cross language barrier 
WHAT is language, and does Scots fit the definition? 
    In the broadest sense, it may. It is a means of shared 
    communication. But is Scots sufficiently differentiated from 
    English to be classified as a separate language, as opposed to 
    dialect? What is its claim to be the language of a particular group 
    or nation? And if it has that status, does that mean those who do 
    not speak it are not Scots?
A key component in any definition of language is that it is held 
    by those most associated with it to be one. But according to a new 
    study, almost two-thirds of the Scottish public do not believe 
    Scots is a real language. The study was commissioned by the SNP and 
    will be seen as a setback to its policy of promoting indigenous 
    Scottish languages. The SNP supports Gaelic, so why not Scots?
Gaelic has long been recognised as an official language. Scots 
    is not a separate language but a collection of regional dialects of 
    the English language. Take away the words, syntax and grammatical 
    structure of the English language, and could Scots stand on its 
    own? Many words are commonly used by Scots. That may make it a 
    potent dialect, but not a language. Supporters may argue that it 
    may not yet be a fully established language in the conventional 
    sense but would become so were it to receive official recognition. 
    But is there in Scotland a majority in favour of such status and 
    the financial and educational implications such status would carry? 
    The poll would seem to indicate: no.
