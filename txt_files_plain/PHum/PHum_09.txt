Age no barrier to learning a new language, say Edinburgh 
    University experts
LEARNING another language boosts brain power, no matter how old 
    you are, according to new research. 
Tests carried out on students suggest that acquiring a new 
    language improves a person’s attention after only a week of study. 
    
Researchers also found that the benefits for mental agility 
    could be maintained with regular practice. 
Edinburgh University researchers assessed different aspects of 
    mental alertness in a group of 33 students aged 18 to 78 who had 
    taken part in a one-week Scottish Gaelic course. 
They compared the results with those of people who had completed 
    a one week course  but not involving learning a new language and 
    with a group who had not completed any course. 
After one week, improvements in attention were found in both 
    groups participating in intensive courses, but only those learning 
    a second language were significantly better than those not involved 
    in any courses. 
The improvement was found for all ages, from 18 to 78, which 
    researchers say demonstrates the benefits of language learning also 
    in later life. Nine months after the initial course all those who 
    had practised five hours or more per week improved from their 
    baseline performance. 
Lead researcher Dr Thomas Bak, of the School of Philosophy, 
    Psychology and Language Sciences, said: “It is never too 
    late to start a novel mental activity such as learning a new 
    language.” 
The study was completed with the help of students from Sabhal 
    Mor Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic language and culture on 
    the Isle of Skye, Highland.
