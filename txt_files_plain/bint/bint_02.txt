joining me now very timely indeed blinded by the sunshine good morning Mister McVicker erm well we'll touch of course erm briefly on the RBS MacTavish Plate a game that we were both down spectating at erm a disappointing result obviously but a a very competitive match I thought and erm Skye played erm they had their chances to win erm yes yeah I mean I think y- you're right Fort William goalkeeper probably had more saves to make than than the Skye goalkeeper had erm and especially towards the in the last five or six minutes of of normal time when Skye really were cranking up the pressure they had they had opportunities to to win the match erm erm yeah yeah and of course when Fort William went ahead they they had a couple of chances if I remember correctly at one nil to extend their lead Skye defense held pretty solid and and then you know after that it was Skye who've probably the better team over over up to the ninety minutes and then Fort William of course an opportunist goal in this ? steal the game really erm erm yeah I mean both teams you'd have to be looking at both teams a lot of youngsters there who they've been around a while but as we keep forgetting they're still very young they so the sh- very good lot of promise in the Skye team obviously a lot of promise in the Fort William team as well and their manager did erm their assistant manager did say afterwards that they are obviously looking to be back competing in  coming-up cup finals in the next maybe three or four years erm he said they're building as well but Skye also building in  that's the sign that they can compete with the any teams above them in any of the leagues really they've I believe not lost to at any team above them this season over ninety minutes erm and just by a single goal there erm yeah and of course again it was it was warm erm warm conditions there both teams very fit because they were still full of running at the end of the extra time even so there's certainly a huge improvement in the in the in the  Skye team well yeah that's that's an argument that's erm an ageism argument but we won't want to go into any these are ageism erm situations but erm I mean I suppose competing at if they're all competing at the same level then yeah you wouldn't expect them as you said if they're only in their t- early teens early twenties to be they should be full of running but again it's erm  it was a competitive match so a lot of a lot of effort was done by both both sides of players anyway that was the game erm sadly erm that was a a long journey home erm on Saturday but erm a chance for John McLeod to lift the his team up for next Saturday where they play at the semi-final of the Ballymore against Inverness at Lochcarron erm yes it'll be a tough we've seen Inverness think twice this season now and it will be a tough match erm yeah well all of that game all of the whole game live on Cuillin FM next Saturday from Lochcarron and so you if you can't make it through there to watch you can listen to it on air and in the comfort of your garden shed or on the couch in the house looking at so that's a sign that erm lot of young blood coming through well yes I suppose this there is that way as well bu- but forgetting ? just catching up ? you know that erm looking ahead though to next Saturday as well because there are erm if I can just find it erm some interesting games a very important game at for you would call it erm in the old days a four pointer erm Inveraray versus Kinlochshiel in the Premiership erm erm Kinlochshiel just two points behind Inveraray in the league and this is a game that they would be hoping to get something out of but Inveraray good result on Saturday erm yeah but I'd it's a game that well both teams want to w- want the points but Kinlochshiel perhaps erm you would you would hope that they went down there was a- last season they had quite a heavy defeat if I remember correctly so they'd be looking to certainly improve on that erm a point would be probably they would be happy with a point yeah that'll be the one that's predict- could decide now we we mentioned erm we did we mentioned Skye of course as well looking at erm just before we we move away from that we've got erm Kinlochshiel the second team are awaiting Newtonmore on Saturday in this Strathdearn cup erm erm erm and of course Lochcarron don't have a game on Saturday at all but erm their manager's going to be busy in action because he will be co-commentating on the Skye Inverness game with Arthur Booth on Saturday so his erm his breakthrough into local radios there we are its a scoop assigned so we signed him up contract well we haven't quite signed the paper right yet we'll give him a packet of crisps erm kind of lemonade after the game that'll be his fee erm yes so now you've had other ? you've had relatively quiet week last week really compared to some weeks erm aye yep there's erm a lot of erm a lot of talent erm on display there and of course you can't beat the local derbies can you erm yeah certainly will it certainly will erm and that's you'll be you you that's before yeah so you'll be there for the day planned out for the day well you've got your plans ready so that's that's good you know what you're doing erm yeah that's erm and Skye are are progressing reasonably well erm but I suppose that's what you really want isn't it competitive leagues so that all all the players stretching have to stretch themselves to to succeed and you don't want easy walk-over yeah erm yeah and yeah that's erm yes yup that's right that's the old traditional style though I feel some some of them don't see it that way anymore no no not at all not at all just erm thinking traditionally yeah yeah yeah indeed indeed erm erm in the local leagues and that'll be that's it for the summer then is it local the winners go on then to play right yeah yeah after the after the summer recess it'll be back again yeah well it gives them something to erm to look forward to and keeps them playing competitive shinty I suppose which is good  oh at least a good chance for some for some retail therapy before and after the game for people I see I mean obviously they're not the only ladies' team that are not playing games so it will be it should be roughly the same scenario for the Glengarry ladies is it tha- yeah yeah which doesn't really help much or if you like erm a shame yeah yup righty ho erm sh- primary that'd be the Portree A team ? top team yeah the A team as they call themselves yeah I'm just looking for for a Snicker advert appearing at the end of the game that they are erm yup as it should be good erm yeah the erm the erm A team had a convincing victory over North End during the week we won't mention the score but it was it was substantial enough enough to say I think yeah better better okay erm shinty lottery draws erm Skye lotto two ten and eleven and where are the numbers no winners seven hundred and fifty pounds and Kinlochshiel shinty lotto numbers drawn were three nine and seventeen again there were no winners and their jackpot next week is five hundred oh you missed that did you oh erm we won't ask what he was doing there then no better not say anything yes so that was th- th- they have they not played in the Camanachd Cup before I th- I thought I'm sure I've seen them a couple of years ago there were the England Camanachd were mentioned somewhere maybe it was a friendly or something official aha well we must mention as well Californian Camanachd who were listening into the game on Saturday thanks to the internet the wonderful and erm indeed yes so they did erm they were listening in and we also had a Skye player sunbathing in Spain listening in as well isn't it just amazing exactly well that's the question you'll have to ask him when he comes back  you you should indeed okay it's time for the What's On it's eight thirty five good morning this they they they certainly did a very competitive game as as as you said to maybe not to reaching the peaks of of some cup finals but erm a competitive game nonetheless and one where Skye possibly let slip the fact that they had the best erm chances in the game and probably more clear-cut chances than Fort William had Fort William had point of shot at goal but erm the de- defense played pretty well and and had restricted them to to shots that didn't trouble Jimmy Keenan in the in the greater part but erm unfortunately they they got erm two to erm one no- normal time yup erm erm the the the conditions played a wee bit of a part too the with the the the strong sun tha- to some points there's trouble with the keepers and they also the wind which Skye had in their favour in first half but which picked up a bit to more in the in the second half erm but erm Skye having started the game well sort of h- went f- went flat for a for a period of time and and had they scored in that in the short period I think k- we would have seen a different outcome but prob- erm pretty much that's that's the way it turned out t- to Fort William a very young team although having said that they they did have a core of experience erm in the in the team particularly in in goalscoring McKennan and erm that was possibly enough just to give them the edge o- over over ninety minutes that's erm they really lo- they've lost two games in both of which have been after extr- extra time and both against teams in higher higher divisions and by a single goal and and erm I think that po- possibly shows so that Skye are making progress and there's not maybe the gulf that erm some people think between the the top divisions and lower divisions yup but erm a little given the fact that we've just said there are a lot of youngsters I'm sure you'd t- you wouldn't expect them to be running out of steam by the end of a hundred and twenty minutes even in a warm day indeed indeed yup semi-final and erm this was probably a greater prize  for Skye Camanachd than the RBS Plate one where they certainly an- an- anticipating progress se- beyond Saturday but erm one where the performance on the f- the finishing from Saturday will will have to improve for to ensure that happens yup erm In- Inverness have always proven to be difficult opponents over the last erm number of years and erm they probably have one or two older players more experienced players as- in the team so it depends how the the the personal battles go there erm erm across the cross the field interesting to to to note that erm Skye Camanachd winners of the Balliemore just erm less than six years ago in two thousand and eight erm and from the score of sixteen that played in that final there there's only five players down there on Saturday in the RBS s- Plate final well it erm it's surprising because a lot of the players that aren't playing are are still erm youngsters still in their twenties good result on Saturday one where they would be expected to to win against erm a team a couple of divisions below them but erm it was achieved without a number of of their their key players senior players erm Garry McPherson Euan McMurdo Douglas Dando Alan McDonald all missing from the line-up erm last Saturday and they're I believe all in contention this coming Saturday so erm possibly there's they're coming out to a better form maybe just at a wrong time for for Kinlochshiel yeah is that th- though though they'll certainly be erm wanting wanting to compete and and I think if they got a point t- they'd be more than happy with that because Lochaber have already been cast adrift a bit at erm ? in the division and the key game for me f- for Kenlochshiel will be against Lochaber yes it was Strathdearn yeah if pro- probably the the the most difficult opponents sa- they could have erm picked t- in the in the Strathdearn draw the Newtonmore team put out of the Sutherland Cup by erm their near neighbours Kingussie and erm they certainly erm have f- f- had a period t- in the last number of years where they'd been very successful and get into the finals of the Reserve Team Cups and they'll certainly be looking to continue progress s- on Saturday and erm Strathdearn particularly as a home game yes I'm sure he'll be delighted compared to some weeks erm that was a relatively q- quiet week erm nothing on show for the Skye under-seventeens but erm as mentioned last week Lochcarron under-seventeens were in action in the MacTavish Juvenile semi-final against erm Kingussie at Strathpeffer where they unfortunately went down four nothing too erm very strong KUC outfit erm and one that will certainly be be looking to to lift the MacTavish Juvenile trophy on Saturday the the twenty first and t- the opposition on the day will be their near neighbours Newtonmore so that erm promises to be a cracking final two very good under-seventeen teams there Newtonmore coming through three nil against Kilmallie in the other semi-final so erm certainly one that erm I'll be looking forward to seeing can't beat the local local derbies and erm both erm in the Newtonmore and KUC ranks there's a number of players playing at second team and even at erm first team level so that we are erm a game worth watching  that's that's erm before the erm main final that's played in the morning of erm Saturday the twenty first I'll be there for the day the Skye under-seventeens were due to play Lochaber in Portree on Tuesday night of this week tomorrow night but erm that game has been postponed for a week so it'll be a week Tuesday erm that that will be played where hopefully Lochaber will provide the opposition for Skye's under-seventeens the next game in the league they're doing reasonably well they they they've ? first ? away to ? a couple of couple of weeks ago which has seen them slip down the erm the league a bit but there are a number of teams all up towards the top end of the league who've dropped points so it's gonna be a a pretty tight league and erm certainly if they manage to beat Lochaber there next week then that will see them right back in the hunt again no you don't erm want situations where teams won't travel for fear of a jobbing or because they're erm a couple of key players short which has always been a bit of a bone of contention where teams are having to travel distances in in that erm they won't travel in unless they think they've got their strongest team out where where for me that's erm the the wrong attitude to take and it's all about to giving the youngsters games erm and as long as you've got twelve players there to to go and that's enough for a team are you saying I'm old erm under-fourteens were in action on Friday night of last week where they took on erm Lochaber erm down at Spean Bridge in the MacMaster Cup quarter final and had a comprehensive victory there that saw Stuart Taylor John Gilles and Marc MacQueen all scoring four goals each erm and that takes s- the under-fourteen team through to the semi-finals of the MacMaster Cup which won't be played until some time in August so that's a a fair distance it's erm away but erm given that the MacMaster is played on the morning of the Camanachd Cup final there's there's plenty of f- time to go yet this week erm the Skye A under-fourteen team are due to play Kinlochshiel at Kirkton at half past six this Friday that's erm a rearranged fixture for one that was postponed earlier in the  in the season due to the due to the wet weather so that's that's just about the the the last of the fixtures in the in the local league well that's that's erm it erm the the w- the winners of erm all of the local leagues go into a division that contains all the local league winners and then we have a division two made up of all the teams that were second in the local leagues and so on and erm generally there there won't be too much activity until the school finishes and then the the the school goes back yeah yeah indeed indeed indeed erm m- mention of the the the ladies that mentioned a couple of weeks ago that erm they were going to be without games it's and erm it still turns out erm that that's the picture and the next game will be Sunday the twenty second of June when they will have their erm women's erm Camanachd semi-final which will be played out at the Bught Park in Inverness yup and Glen- Glengarry will provide the opposition there and erm certainly a a team that the leads have managed to to beat in the past and one where they'll be hopeful if if they've got a full outfit yeah yeah but erm they they can progress to the final erm b- it it it it it will be something something of the same nature erm and erm the their games tend tend to be infrequent and also given that there's a small number of f- erm teams in the in the ladies' divisions pos- possibly only f- is it four or so in the divisions erm then spread out over the course of a season that your n- your games aren't gonna come erm week on week which which doesn't help erm I know that they had tried to arrange a a friendly fixture but erm that has fallen fallen flat erm and erm it's always it's erm difficult to to gain erm opposition for that level right primary action there's primary action last last week erm wh- that erm saw the P- Portree erm went out over North End erm last mid-week erm and erm primary schools league and erm this erm coming week I believe there is a Macaulay Cup tournament down in Fort William where Portree will be participating I don't have any more details than than than that but erm that's a a  a one-off erm one-day tournament to in Fort William this week that's Tuesday that will be that will be the Portree top team erm erm which which erm o- on reflection who when we saw the Bank of Scotland their tournament erm a couple of Fridays ago when the teams from north south east and west are all mixed together and it provided a very competitive erm erm league ya yeah erm just one final erm thing to mention and erm something that erm slipped under my radar last week was the first foray into competitive cup shinty for the English Shinty Association who who took part in the Bullough Cup a week past Saturday where the goalkeeper was none other than Skye's own John ? MacLeod and erm he helped to keep the English in the game before they eventually went down two nil to Ballachulish no that's that's that's the first erm competitive erm erm official cup match erm and the team was made up largely from what was London Camanachd and also from Cornwall Camanachd the wonders of technology and why wasn't he playing I'll have a word with the manager
