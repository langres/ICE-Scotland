independence doesn't an- a- and look and talking to other business people being independent doesn't scare me at all being a businessman I remember when I had the first when I had an opportunity to start my own business  I was terrified I had two three days of sleep- sleepless nights thinking yo- can I do this will I do it since I've done it it made me work a lot harder I was scared of failure all the other things that every other small medium business has to cope with for people who'd make that quantum leap and I don't know many of them that would actually go back and say no I d- I want to actually go back and I want to be an employee again having control of your own business erm is one of the most satisfying things erm you obviously have to work harder making that business work both for you and the people you're responsible for i e your employees it's not a easy decision to make it's quite a frightening erm thing well it certainly was for me and I imagine mo- most business people will have had the same experience but the satisfaction and actually getting that business running getting the business successful now making the business profitable is a very satisfying one absolutely the parallels erm I think are almost exactly the same w- I had the opportunity to open a restaurant here at Gleneagles Hotel and that was a very very daunting thing to do and when the f- contract was first put to me I had said to the hotel wasn- you know can we try this for a little while and the foresight at that time for well from the hotel was no if you're gonna do it then you gonna have to do it all on your own erm and it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me erm I suppose everyone is concerned erm and that's only natural I think anyone who's in business they just like to be reassured that what's what's coming in the future and and nobody can tell us that i- i- if you listen to the political chat surrounding erm making the decision on independence is very very hard for anyone to make make a decision on that erm but there's no guarantees with anything I just think that looking forward I actually feel very excited and a lot of the people business people I know feel exactly the same come September the eighteenth when it comes to actually putting that cross on a sheet of paper for do we have ambition do we want to be successful do we want to grow our economy do we want to grow as a nation do we want to instill some pride in our own country then I think for those that are I don't know I definitely think that their decision will be a yes I can't imagine that people will settle for where they are without actually having the ambition to grow and do you see a connection there between starting up your own business and starting up Scotland as an independent country but what response do you get from other business people when you're talking to them about independence are they concerned are they afraid
