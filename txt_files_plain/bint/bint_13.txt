as things currently stands we'd we'd we'd be at risk of overspending to the tune of around eight million but we can't do that and we need to bring it down to zero so what the board has done today it has approved an in-year recovery plan which was presented to the board which looks at going further into some of the some of the measures that have been taken to to make sure we do deliver financial balance which is we're required to do erm the main headings are locums so we spend a significant amount of money on locums in common with other boards I think that's been out in the press today and and I think the pr- erm boards in the northern area ay- are partish- are particularly sort of hard hit with being able to recruit so locums is one area we're looking at the way we provide out-of-hours services particularly where there's sort of last minute erm erm replacements of of of locums with that sometimes is particularly expensive so we're looking at whether we can use contingencies there we're looking at supplementary staffing where erm we have additional staff brought onto wards for example staying in overnight and a situation we're seeing if we can do that more efficiently erm in common erm in in in tandem with our clinical colleagues we're looking at drugs the way we prescribe drugs erm and also procurement what we pay for goods and services better use of national contracts trying to reduce our stock levels for example erm so there's there's a there's a wide range of things and I think the important message is we're working in co- in in in you know in in erm close collaboration with our clinical colleagues so that there will be clinical binds to all the measures we're taking and the board are very clear that that that's what they wanted us to do I think it's possible yes I think we're moving in the right direction there's clearly a lot lot still to do but I think there's a there's a real attention to detail now in the organisation and and a real sort of grip on the financial position and we've got a clear mandate from the board you know to to go further and make sure we do break even but yes it's still gonna be a real challenge from now until the end of the financial year and what sort of things will you be targeting is so that drive now that March is an achievable target to break even
