a very good morning to you and this week we're looking at Rewind the festival of course for the eighties and we are the official radio station for that particular weekend looking forward to very much indeed my guest this morning is Midge Ure one of the artists who will be taking to the stage on the Saturday Midge good morning to you how are you then yeah and and busy as well I would imagine that's fantastic and well we'll talk about Rewind in a moment but going back to your history mean I I know we have spoken before about it but I think it's always great to go back to the the the bands that you were associated with like Slik Rich Kids Visage Ultravox did they did the success of Ultravox sort of settle you in the music business mhm interesting when you say the link there isn't it because it just does go from band to band what about erm Thin Lizzy you were involved with Thin Lizzy at one point how did that come about mhm yeah yeah what fantastic memories wasn't it great absolutely tremendous moving on to to the solo career how important was the solo number o- one hit If I Was for you yeah and I suppose it was just yet another step in in your own career wasn't it moving forward mhm mhm Vienna by Ultravox is seen by many erm including myself as a song that should have got to number one but was stopped by Joe Dolce did did that hurt at the time yeah yeah right we're talking about erm meeting up with old friends backstage are they friends or are they rivals mhm yeah good period in music good atmosphere and in Rewind in the in what in what they've built up I mean twenty five acts over two days twenty thousand people each day erm a- at Scone Palace a tremendous setting as well I suppose the timing of Rewind's pretty good Midge as you have just released erm your new album Fragile erm that's coming out seventh of July is that right right wha- what can we expect on that album then mhm and how long have you been working on this Midge has it been a yeah you've been you've been busy in between must be the longest ever somebody's ever how long have you been working on an album well twelve years now brilliant I just had to get that one out I was waiting on the answer there twelve years is amazing erm so erm looking forward to Rewind then what can we expect from you on the Rewind stage mhm erm they are indeed and erm I think that's why erm it is so successful as a f- as a festival and in the short time it's been on in Scotland it's the fact that the everybody knows the artist and they know the songs and they come along to sing along and enjoy it don't they yeah well we're looking forward to seeing you there erm erm erm on the the Saturday of the weekend erm and we'll keep our fingers crossed for good weather and we'll chat to you then Midge thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning good morning I I'm really well you know I'm really enjoying life right now I did well that keeps me entertained that's why I'm enjoying myself it's erm erm I'm out there doing stuff it's great you know I I'd I'd think it was always settled erm but do you know if you look back at my erm you know the career it's it looks a bit random  but there's a there's a lineate direct through the entire thing you know forget Slik because it was erm that was that that I I'd no control over the music and and that area but with the Rich Kids erm you know I bought a synthesizer which broke the band up and half the band took the synthesizer and set up Visage so we were in the studio with Visage working with our favourite musicians one of whom happened to be Billy Currie keyboard player with Ultravox and I ended up joining Ultravox when they kind of fell apart erm so there there there's a there's a continuation all the way through so finding Ultravox I think was great for me because I learned so much from those guys they were already using all this lovely technology mixed in with traditional rock instruments so it's exactly what I wanted to do so it was just fortuitous that I was kind of there at the right time I was in the studio finishing off erm this first Visage album erm with Fade to Grey on it and erm and I got a telephone call from erm Phil Lynott now who I'd known then you know we were friends and he called me up from Arkansas erm and I thought how how lovely ? Arkansas and erm and erm he said Gary Moore is not in the band anymore we're opening up for erm Journey with special guest we're playing in front of twenty thousand people a night we got three weeks to go can you come and finish the tour and erm and and I'd I I went home that night to find a big pile of cassettes in my flat with the set list and an aeroplane ticket and erm and I packed all my stuff and I got my big ghetto blaster coz it was before you had you know personal walkman things and erm they sent me on Concorde and I was happy to the second song tried to learn it in my head when we landed so I had I'd very little time to thinking of doing any of this stuff within forty eight hours of getting the phone call I was on stage playing with Thin Lizzy they're great it was great it was fabulous stuff erm I think doing the solo thing was important for me having a number one is a icing on the cake you know that's that's great you nobody sets out to write erm you know a number one record otherwise everyone would be doing it you know it's a it's still a rare thing these days to to to you know sell a million copies and erm and and it was great for me coz I I I kind of but you know I I'm I was doing this within the confines of Ultravox you know we'd taken a break from each other for the the first time ever and during that break I started recording some solo stuff and that became the the first solo album erm and the unfortunate thing is that w- a- Band Aid and Live Aid and all of that stuff came along at the same time which took me away from Ultravox for two years and when you're apart from your partners your friends you know for your ? erm for for a a long time when you get back together again you're very different people so Ultravox never really worked after that so erm the the solo thing just seemed to make perfect sense to me to go off and and explore working with other musicians erm in different areas of music like the Chieftains and erm and you know Mark King Forever Forty Two and all of that stuff that was very appealing at the time ? sometimes sometimes you kind of think maybe a step backwards so erm because erm you know erm what we should have done with Ultravox I think in hindsight coz we're all clever with hindsight erm is maybe ride it through because Ultravox were a very strong very creative band and erm just because you're hitting a bit of a hard time you know you you don't just pack in your marriage and walk away because it's getting a bit rough you know you try and work through it erm and you get to something better at the end of the the tunnel and we should maybe have done that but you know youth and naivety and ego and all of that stuff all mixes in and you think now that's doesn't work anymore we'll go and do something else erm yeah I think it was just a bit odd really you know erm it it's it's a bit like you know the Beatles being stopped to you know from going to number one because of you know Ernie's Fastest  Milkcart  In The West that was except that was actually quite a good song Ernie's Fastest Milkcart In The West it was very clever erm this was just one of these weird you know great British record buying you know the the me- a- the anomalies erm you know why they would buy this thing I'll never know but they did and thirdly it got to number one that's fine but we we sat at number two for five weeks erm s- outselling both records that went to number one at the time oh I think I think everyone was a musical rival at the time erm the the one guy in fact maybe two of them I think erm Level Forty Two are doing it this year aren't they erm as I'll have in seventeen and both contain two of my greatest friends you know Glenn Gregory and and Mark King and we we became friends back there in the day but erm I can't say the same for a lot of the other bands I think we were was too much you know were erm you know make-up envy or you know hairspray envy or too much sucking your cheeks in you know trying to outdo each other erm at the time and erm you know a bit of nonsense but now of course you know well we're all friends we're all we can all see the appeal that you know each other had you know we can see the quality of what we you know we kind of brought to the table we're you know we were all good songwriters and I think that maybe that's why the Rewind festivals are s- as popular as as they are right now because the songs involved in that era were just erm great you know it was a really good period in music that at a glorious setting it's absolutely beautiful so and I'm really looking forward to it it'll it'll be some day yeah well you know it's a it's it's very much me erm you know I think is erm erm you know if if you just heard the track getting randomly played on the radio you'd you'd probably suspect that was me erm 
is my kind of trademark things erm but I'd again I'd I'd have tried to kind of I've tried to think of what this album actually is and it's that sort of album that you can only really make when you've had a a lifetime in music erm a lifetime creating music and making music erm it's not an album full of you know three-minute hit singles or potential singles it's an album in old-school terms of an album would it be you put it on at the beginning and it takes you through a bit of a journey through the entire thing and hopefully by the end of the last track you want to put it back on at the beginning again so it's kind of going against the grain erm of of the the erm the you know the multitude of writers and producers all trying to turn out erm you know hit after hit after hit which which is fine but it becomes very repetitive so this is hopefully the antidote to that oh that's that's a ridiculous amount of time I started the album erm I know you're laughing coz you know I started the album nearly twelve years ago erm but I I've done a few things in in the I've not been sitting about ? waiting for inspiration well you either have to be very very stupid to do that or incredibly confident now about your abilities to bounce back erm well nothing from the new album you know I think it's just the wrong environment erm tha- erm these the Rewind things are great because of they're hit-laden they're just it's hit after hit it's like a it's like a live jukebox you know it's a you know there's nothing challenging there it's there it's ent- it's pure and utter entertainment you know whereas if I was doing the Isle of Wight Festival or Glastonbury or whatever I would slip in some new songs and erm you know it's a different a different environment but this is all about erm the hits so it's making people feel you know comfortable and erm erm erm erm and safe in  their kind of musical choices so and and of course you you look at all the artists that are on over the weekend and if you start to count up how many records they've sold in total it's a huge amount of records for the big artists yeah of course they do of course they do an absolute pleasure thank you
