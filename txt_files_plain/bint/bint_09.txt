yeah absolutely delighted to be selected as part of team Scotland in the hockey team it's a a great day here that the final team has been announced and it's really exciting I'm always honoured to to lead the team out but I think it's extra special to lead your team out in front of a home crowd at Glasgow Commonwealth Games yeah well a lot of people are talking about the Commonwealth Games which is more than previous years because that's a high profile because it's whe- it's in Scotland I think the home crowd'll give us that little extra edge yeah I do still remember Manchester which was my first game and I was a youngster at that point and I certainly looked upon the more experienced members in the squad for advice and help then so maybe I can pass some of my previous experience on to them well the best we finished in the past was in Melbourne when we finished fifth so we're looking to do better than that erm to finish in the top four it's a difficult challenge but it's one that we will be working really hard to try and break into yeah it's an excellent facility erm Glasgow Glasgow Green and we've been training in it in the last year so I think that's gonna have a real advantage because we're used to the stadium we're used to the to the set-up and the turf and everything it's an excellent surface erm and I think the fact that already it's been used by a lot of schools it's been used by a lot of clubs so it's getting a lot of use already so think that's fantastic for hockey as a whole yeah it has been intense we've been working really hard but I think the beauty of full-time training is that you can work really hard but you al- c- can also fit in the the quality rest in there as well so you can get home rest recover and go hard again the next day yeah well we're always looking to promote hockey it is a fantastic game and I've been playing it for a number of years now so it's obviously really enjoyable erm it's really competitive it keeps you fit and you also make great friends along the way as well so I think if we can raise the profile of hockey a little bit get some good coverage then it's for all all good for the sport you're obviously gonna be leading the team out as well how much of an honour is that and what should the how much of a advantage do you think that you know the home crowd will be certainly added a buzz to the build-up what about the actual competitive edge and obviously you is it your role as as captain and a more experienced member to to help the younger guys handle that that kind of pressure and expectation what's the realistic target for the team what's being made of all the new facilities in stadia erm the hockey facility in particular it's excellent how exciting is it to be part of that and you mentioned the training there you know what's the what's the regime been like how how intense has it been is it a bigger kind of aim here maybe not something that you guys are thinking about at the moment but I suppose this is a chance to turn more people on to hockey whether it's playing you know or even spectating
