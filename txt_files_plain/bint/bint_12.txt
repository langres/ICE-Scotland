well I think the working group will look at how quickly we can erm allow the public to access the the castle it's a historic and erm you know very high profile building for the city and it's surely important that the pub- the public who're visiting those tourists are able to access that and get the boost from it but also that the Highland public are able to get in and use this building I'd like to see things like weddings being held and people being able to use it as a real backdrop for their lives well we need to have that castle open tourists do flock there and erm often they're taking pictures with police vans and erm people coming out of the court you know it's just not acceptable we need to make sure that these buildings that erm in this city that moves forward for the whole of the Highlands are available for the public to access and make the most of this tourist attraction that we have here right in the heart of the Highlands well I must say that the court service the government everybody who's been involved in looking at the possibilities so far's been very accessible and very helpful and we hope that all of the different people and agencies that are coming together look at this will actually be able to put some action into it so we can finally free up this major asset for the availability of the public and we already do have erm a lot of visitors going up there already assuming it's already a tourist attraction so and erm but they're finding that the building is actually closed off to them so it's erm kind of makes sense that you would open up to them there's obviously been this public feeling in the city for quite a long time that something should be done with the castle and and in those terms that this really seems to be a step in the right direction in terms of the council getting behind it the government getting behind it to- towards an actual solution
