Louise how's training been going for the Commonwealth Games it's a lot of work for just thirty seconds as you say take me through your training how difficult is it how many hours are you spending in the gym you're from Glasgow the Commonwealth Games are in Glasgow how how much does that mean to you yeah we've watched it at other big events that the home athletes always do seem to do that little bit better and that's what you're obviously expecting in Glasgow when you started a year and a half ago did you believe that you could could make it to this stage so soon yeah I can just see from the the smile on your face how happy you are to be here erm training's been emotional erm but we're going in the right direction so erm I'm really happy I'm really looking forward to to having my I think it's thirty seconds that is pretty much the amount of time that you spend on the platform but I'm I'm really looking forward to it yes yes it some days it feels like a lot of work and some days it feels like the best the best activity really you could spend your your life doing so erm well it varies depending on what we're what we're trying to improve erm so at the moment I I'm trying to just work on my speed still gain a little bit of strength erm work on technique so at the moment we're training for about two hours a day a little bit of that is talking a little bit of that is warming up erm but it's it ends up about two hours and we'll do some form of squats some form of strength and then we'll do a little bit of technique so your your competition lifts which are your snatch on your your clean and jerk and work on them for a little while and then I I try to spend at least a kind of last quarter of the training session working on what I think is my weakness and try and turn it into a strength eventually well obviously I I love I've lived all my life in Glasgow I was from erm Loch Ormond originally erm but all of my adult life in in Glasgow and anytime I went anywhere else I've always wanted to come home so erm I think having the Glaswegians behind you there's no other crowd like that in  in the world whether it's weightlifting or whether it's erm a rock gig you know Glaswegians know how to  have a a good time and I'm I'm  I I I'm really excited erm to see what having that many people behind you feels like it's I I respond well to to positive reinforcement so having my friends and family there who've who have seen through like some some difficult days erm and and having them there and and getting I want them to be like part of the party so to speak erm that would just that would just make my day so yes I'm I'm hoping I want me to bring out some PBs and I would I've really like to have a good time and and enjoy this being since it's my first first games and I've only been in weightlifting for a year and a half so erm this will be quite an event so I'm I'm hoping I don't erm fall apart and erm it's a difficult question because I'm I'm ever the optimistic erm kind of individual so for example when the I've been training for a couple of months coz I went to see the Olympics took my sister for her birthday came back from the Olympics I should have a go at that sport I'm quite strong and  and things and erm after that I found a coach and then the qualification totals came out and erm my coach just said I think these are achievable and our team manager sat down was like think if you drop a weight cut your goal will definitely be achievable and erm I looked at them and I definitely I definitely thought they were within my my spectrum but erm there were definitely a few training sessions where I thought there was no no no chance at all so erm we got through them and erm yeah there was obviously moments of doubt along the way but the last couple of months have all been positive and and ready to go yes I I am delight- this is  is exciting you know I always said I wouldn't get excited until my my name was in the paper even though I'd made the the qualification standard and things like that so now I get to be excited and and tell everybody that I'm going to the to the games which is pretty cool
