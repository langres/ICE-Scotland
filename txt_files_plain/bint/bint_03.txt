Skye Half's quite a good course for me erm Gordon's great on flats he was actually pushing the flats earlier on and I was thinking if he keeps like this I might struggle to keep with him but thankfully I must have got enough of a lead by the turning point tha- I think it was about three hundred four hundred yards and I kept that lead until Drumuie and by the top of Drumuie I felt I was feeling pretty good I think I think I've got this in the bag so now I just  put the pace down and ? I was five minute miling the last couple of miles which is great great way to finish and erm as a bonus finished upright this year and not not collapsing in the heat and in an ambulance yes the co- conditions were much better this year I mean there was a I think erm fourteen degrees cloud cover not much wind yes it was yeah I mean the previously the my form has been as when you're running hard on that course coz it's so hilly you lose a lot of fluid and it's getting you back in this might have been my problem it's always been a problem but today I didn't lose so much fluid ? the problem and erm yeah I'm I'm delighted with the performance and hopefully this year I try and break seventy minutes Great North Run's the next target yeah so that's to say I'll meet up with my coach next week and we'll discuss a plan for breaking seventy there erm it's interesting actually because it's the this new approach is just is bas- I'll meet up with my coach and I'll say this is what I'd like to do and she'll advise me about maybe doing a bit more a bit less and between the two of us it seems to be working erm and the mileage is kind of a lot of it more my sight where I say how much I'm feeling I want to do how much I need to do and it's a more relaxed approach to the training and it's getting the results so yeah absolutely that's part of it you've got to be very confident as a runner and erm mentally you've got to be focussed on what's k- you're gonna do and and especially on a day like today where you do have a quality runner like Gordon Lennox running I mean I had to react a few times to pres- what he was doing and increase injections of pace charging hills erm and if to be honest I've never beat this is a race that I've I've not had that opportunity to do that it was good to test my a side of my my racing today because you know on Skye I don't get to run against such good runners very often so I was I and to be honest if Gordon Lennox wasn't around today I might not run so quickly coz he was pushing me the whole way pretty much right erm generally that's that's a slower portion of the course I think that's I was about five forty mile there which is reasonable given the in- incline erm I was also five forty mile going up Dramuie which again's pretty good I mean if you can do that then you're you're you're on a good pace erm yeah because I mean right yeah erm I I have always got this rule that I never look behind me in a race coz I think you just it's it's wasting energy and it's also encouraging the guy behind you to speed up by so I always make a point in never doing that but it was it's good to know where they are that might be an idea for next year actually aye but he's a he's a top quality athlete Gordon he he's he's come on leaps and bounds he just he trains really hard he does quite a lot of races erm as I said seventy one in Inverness put him in the top five and that was a that was elite athletes running that race so yeah yeah I would I would probably put that as one of the hardest in Britain and that's not exaggerating erm and what we try to do with the Skye Half is like it was always a great race but we've we've tried to maybe bring it up to standard of other national Half Marathons so like we've added isotonic drinks this year the winners' medal custom-made with the branding the running-specific t-shirts erm the chip timing as well which has been a g- a great thing to bring in we also added a tink- tinky clock which we got great feedback about erm I mean they seem like little things but brought together it just helps raise the race's profile bring it up to a good standard yup absolutely it is the Great North Run so erm so is the fl- that'll be the focus in the next couple of months erm I'll meet up with erm Karen next week and we'll workin- we'll work out a plan for that erm given that it's a more relaxed approach it might be a week to week or just to say what we are doing there and there and then work I know roughly the mileage I need to be doing which is for me it's between seventy and eighty and we can do this three sessions a week erm and I'm trying the approach is like I'm doing treadmill work ? good for and I'm I'm getting good responses to that as well because erm what I used to get was more the call it tempo work we had to run at Half Marathon pace it's hard to do that on Skye coz of the undulations whereas now I'll try and do that on the treadmill coz it's a specific pace and there is just no getting out of that you've got to do that pace so yeah yeah so I'll maybe do that on a Monday Wednesday intervals on the grass I even tried a erm a lighter road interval session long run on Sunday just that is that's kind of what I'm doing at the moment and erm with a view to try to break seventy minutes at the Great North and on the basis of the day it's very possible twelfth of September I think oh yeah yes since she was she was out on the course there supporting me today which was excellent erm yeah Karen's got off a very good running record and it's erm well established and been to the Olympics and it's great having someone of that ability and erm local local honour in the area that I can just meet up with and we can erm it's erm coz I say it a lot I had a coach in Glasgow and the correspondence was by email and it's not the same he's not really seeing me and how I'm feeling and I'm aye it's hard to get across how you're you're feeling as well whereas with this f- more relaxed approach I can sort of better explain how my body is going why I'm doing things a certain way and then she can advise me yeah that's the right thing to do and it's it's a better way of doing it definitely so we'll see how we're going erm I'm planning on doing London next year as well the London Marathon coz erm basically I wasn't too ba- I I never never broke seventy minutes for the Half I never broke two thirty for the Marathon so plans to break seventy for the Half this year and try and keep that speed try and break two thirty at London next year oh right of course he is yeah although although although I do not did he or not play at the tournament recently or so yeah aye thank you yeah yeah that's it's a massive boost for the local economy and it's great that Skye can put on such a an event like that and erm and the running is really professionally as well and I think that you know the word's gonna getting out that this is the kind of race that we're offering and you know we've got the stunning backdrop of the Isle of Skye to host it in so assu- I I I can see it growing year to year erm and yeah it's great for the Skye economy and I hope it continues to absolutely yeah I mean well the last two years it's been twenty plus degree heat which is well in my case it's too hot because I I just can't cope with running like that hard in the heat on a hilly course but today it was fourteen degrees perfect and it made it made  it meant that I could focus more on my run didn't have to worry about my fluids so much and yeah there were some nice breezes in parts yeah so it was all round all round successful event and erm great to see so many people taking part and we hope it continues to grow erm we get a lot of support from the voluntary groups as well like the yeah the the Brownies and you know and the Portree FC gave us a couple of guys to help out as well so it's great to see the other organisations in the community coming to help out yeah s- absolutely we need that success that support's critical yeah thank you I'm playing football for Portree ? ? aye yeah the day today was very good erm I got the chance to to run today and erm unlike Hugh I was I wasn't under as much pressure I was under a wee bit of pressure enough because everybody was saying to me oh you'll breeze this and erm I think people were expecting me to cross the line and go round again if you like you know erm no the Skye Half marathons are very tough course very challenging but we did okay I came in at time one hour and fifty three I think it was fine you know it was fine I hadn't trained since I did the Skye run I hadn't been doing a lot of training certainly not preparing for the Half Marathon coz that's not really my thing nowadays but it's nice to to support the Half Marathon wha- what they're doing it's nice to to run the local races erm so we we did okay today erm I wasn't as fit as I should be for it because after the Skye run I also took the I took my foot off the gas I've still got problems with my feet and things but erm no it was a pleasure to do it and erm thanks to Scott and the team up there they they asked me would I be part of the the prize giving although ? hear that's nice to be asked to do that and erm so that was quite an honour to erm stand your man here ? with the prize you know erm which which was erm no it was a nice thing to do and a nice thing to be asked to do so I'm I'm really grateful for that you know nice breezes as well ? as well yeah sometimes
