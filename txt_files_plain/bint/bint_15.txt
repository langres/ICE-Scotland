and the Education Secretary Angela Constance spoke to Scotland Tonight earlier this evening you say you're going to draw on schemes with a a proven track record like the London Challenge what specifically are you taking from ? initiative erm given that this London Challenge has been tried in other parts of the country with varying degrees of success what makes you think it would work in Scotland okay so how do you go about targeting this additional funding towards the children who need it most erm but not all children from poor gra- backgrounds live in deprived areas so won't some of the most deprived erm children erm be be left out won't won't be targeted if they live mo- in more affluent areas that won't be targeted as a result okay but the erm there's some pace being in government for for more than seven years now erm why has this not been tackled before why's this gap been allowed to to get s- so so so big between the rich and poor children Angela Constance thank you for joining us on Scotland Tonight well there's some very good practice that's existing in Scotland it's important that we look at evidence from elsewhere in tems of the London Challenge what we liked about the London Challenge was that it was flexible it was backed up by long-term funding and that's why we've drawn on that experience erm the Scottish Attainment Challenge will be backed up with a hundred million pounds erm over a four-year period and it will allow very bespoke erm plans to take place in schools erm where we have a a high proportion of children in need erm so the Scottish Attainment Challenge is very focused on closing the attainment gap by long-term funding and very flexible funding mhm mhm it is important to recognise that you can't import some DLC system erm into your own country we've got great schools in Scotland lots of innovative practice erm lots of existing programmes that are focused on raising attainment but we're very clear that we now want to pick up the pace and there are aspects of the London Challenge that we believe will work well in a Scottish context ? do some things different from the London Challenge erm we're starting in primary schools as opposed to secondary schools that's what they did in London erm we've got a proud record of early intervention erm we've led to be pioneered work in early years and we now want to do some focused work and focused investment in primary schools particularly in those areas of most need mhm of what we know there are particular areas in Scotland where there's a a high proportion of children from erm more deprived households and what we know with the attainment gap and that's essentially a difference between erm children from the least and most disadvantaged backgrounds we know that that attainment gap can be as much as thirteen months in literacy by a time a child is five so we need to act early erm to ensure that that attainment gap doesn't grow as a child progresses through the schooling but that actually that we close that attainment gap because we've got great schools in Scotland a good history of pioneering education in Scotland but we don't want to rest on our laurels we don't want to leave any child behind in Scotland it it is very important that we continue to expand a good universal offer it is absolutely correct to say that every school in Scotland will have children that need additional assistance that will have children who are at risk of not reaching their full potential because of their background that's why last year we announced the raising attainment for our programme that's already in a hundred and fifty schools that's why in the programme for government we announced attainment advisors that will be attached to every erm local government that's why we continue to invest heavily erm in the curriculum for excellence but we know that for some areas and for some children they need that additional targeted resource well actually there's evidence erm international evidence that shows that the attainment gap in Scotland has begun to narrow since two thousand and nine we've seen improvement erm in you know reading science and maths but you know for this government we want to pick up the pace because while any gap exists that's just not good enough erm education is the passport from poverty is the passport to a better place I want Scotland to be the best place to learn the best place for our children erm to grow up and and we can't have a Scotland where any child is left behind
