well joining us now is Doctor Jennifer Logue a clinical senior lecturer in metabolic medicine from Glasgow University thanks for joining us I've got to tell I'm raging I I fo- for for years I like full fat milk and I've never had it for years is it is it for the wrong reasons mhm so we've got erm we got full butter here erm we've got erm you know a a a spread I suppose we would call it there we've got low fat yoghurt we got erm that that's full fat yoghurt low fat yoghurt what's the difference erm are they both could you eat them both equally and be perfectly mhm mhm ? a few there so i- i- is it too much to say the advice was wrong erm why is that the case what why has it not been followed up we heard at the end of the report there erm Karen's report she said you know y- y- your granny was right everything in in moderation so should people say ah well I now can have butter or should they still be cautious Doctor Logue thank you very much ? thank you I think it's quite a complicated subject the problem erm that the researchers have highlighted today is while the evidence showed that okay if you take two groups of people ones that eat a lot of fat and ones that don't eat a lot of fat the ones that don't eat a lot of fat had less heart attacks and that's really what the evidence is based on what they weren't able to erm base the evidence on was saying to the population as a whole eat less fat and seeing whether that reduced the risk of heart attacks they only found about two and a half thousand erm people's worth of data to actually back that up and that wasn't enough to be able to show the effect and that's what they're claiming is erm a problem mhm so we got two different things here if we stick to the the kind of spreads and the butters in your butter you've got saturated fat and in your spread you've got polyunsaturated fat these are things you hear in adverts all the time now the difference with that is it's felt that the polyunsaturated fats reduce cholesterol and the saturated fats lead to higher cholesterol and we think that causes heart disease what we've got with the yoghurts is perhaps something slightly different if you've got a low fat yoghurt and a high fat yoghurt we think that a low fat yoghurt's healthier coz that's what we've been told over the years but the problem is is that that's not just low fat yoghurt that's low fat yoghurt with about three spoonfuls of sugar added to it as well so yes it might be better having less fat but having less fat plus all the sugar is that actually better than just having the fat alone and that's where the problems happened here you've still got to eat so for eating less fat we're eating more carbohydrates more sugar more bread more pasta and you know yourself if you eat a bowl of pasta you don't feel that full you can eat a big plate of pasta before you really feel full yeah that's it and it's a big problem and that possibly has fuelled the obesity epidemic which has led to diabetes which ironically will result in more heart disease I think the advice was well meaning at the time I think the mistake has been that thirty years has gone past without further research being pursued in this area and I think that needs to be done urgently as the authors of this paper suggest I don't know erm I wish I knew coz I do research in this area but I think the problem is a lot of research is really based around diseases so we have research funded into heart disease research funded into diabetes erm cancer we don't really have research funded into nutrition and these studies you know I alluded to they got to be huge they got to be erm really big you have to actually do things like have study supermarkets so that you can sell people the food and know exactly what they're they're eating to be able to control it so they're very expensive studies to do and they're very difficult logistically and I think just no one's been able to get funding to do studies like that I think you need to be cautious in terms of saturated fats versus polyunsaturated fat I think the advice from thirty years ago of throw away your frying pan and don't fry everything and decrease the amount of meat was probably correct you just have to be careful of what you're eating instead and make sure that you're eating plenty of protein fish lean meats fruit and vegetables and not just filling up on white bread and pasta and sugars and and junk food thank you
