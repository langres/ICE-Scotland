we've got erm Mister McLeod the Skye manager with us now John Russ congratulations well done a workman-like performance in the end probably  erm you you played some great shinty in the first half and and nearly all of that came through came through Shocky a foot forward to he got the first goal and then set up the second for for Campbell do you do you th- it was also it was a big blow when he went when when he when he went off injured do you think that affected you for the next for the rest of the game yeah th- erm I mean full respect Inverness for for making it difficult erm erm for you at th- particularly in the second half I think the breeze helped them and I think they got a a bit more of a foothold in midfields erm and that's I thought that changed when you brought Iain Murray back on obviously coming off a a back off a a narrow defeat last week in the cup final you'll be looking for erm looking for a a a more positive result in the in the Balliemore final is there erm anyone you'd prefer over Aberdour or Ballachulish will you have anyone down at the island next week scouting ? and erm  on on Shocky's injury so was it just a precautionary coz it was a a bit of a headknock or and erm looking ahead to the rest of the season erm people obviously it was a disappointment for Skye not not to get into the national division last season di- do you think it'd be fair to say that erm the the supporters and and players e- e- would expect to win the league and the Balliemore this year do you think it's a- a- as harsh as that and how how is the the new t- this e- even maybe you've been asked this before but e- erm it's new for me erm how's the the new policy with the the no train no play erm coming on and it's erm great to see the younger players coming on Jordan erm Murchison came on there and erm Will Will Cowie played a full ninety minutes erm I thought he was erm excellent his movement is is something that I'm glad I'm not playing against perfect thanks very much John Ross yeah it was tough erm we made it kind of difficult for ourselves there were lot of chances there in the first half maybe should have been a bit more comfortable but you know we clawed our way erm they came back and turned a wee bit but erm our defense stood strong and erm we're delighted to be erm into the final which is great yeah yeah yeah absolutely I mean we had to change ours- change our shape I mean we're on the erm offensive you know when Shocky was here he was a good target  man for us up front erm but when he came off you know erm it was probably a wise decision but erm we had to change things around and we lost our composure a wee bit we lost our rhythm but erm in fairness you know we kept at it it wasn't pretty I know it wasn't pretty but erm we got that last goal at the end which just erm sealed it which was great yeah I mean the Iain had a wee leg rope there which was he sort of erm Doctor Bank sorted out which is so- again we were we were put out of our rhythm and had to make changes we pulled Gibbs MacDonald back to the f- the defense here erm which again we lost a wee bit momentum in the in the centre line so with all these changes you know it was it was always gonna upset our our rhythm a wee bit well we'll just take whoever's erm whoever comes our way you know we we're playing well we well I mean it was a grind today we grinded out a result erm but at the end of the day it doesn't matter erm who's in the final we'll prepare the same way and erm we'll approach it the same ways which is erm the way we do things erm I don't think so I think the we'll just do our own thing and see where that takes us you know erm erm it's up to other teams to worry about us but we'll just keep doing the things we're doing and it seems to be working and we'll we'll winning the games well well seems he was out cold erm erm for ou- about a minute erm but he wanted the the advice of Doctor Banks here erm with this erm concussion policy it was decided maybe just to take him off and erm give him a bit of a rest erm which is erm the best way to look at it I mean there there's a lot of people expecting but I mean we we we just go about our business and we're playing every game as it comes you know erm it's up to us to win the league and not win the cups and erm the only way we'll do that is by working hard during the week and performing on a Saturday it's it's it's working I mean the b- the boys have put a lot of work into it since I mean we started in November December and erm you know the boys have grafted away you can see they are a lot fitter and they're keen and and that's all we can ask of them and it's shown in their performances week in week out yeah he was fantastic he's had a great season erm he's just a the only thing that was affecting us today again was there was a few of them under the  weather with a heavy cold Chris Rose erm Will Cowie as well erm was absolutely shattered at the end there's an just really a they're under the weather but they it was good good for them to last the ninety minutes I know no bother Ross thanks very much for that
