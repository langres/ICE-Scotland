I'm delighted to welcome in the studio my guest he's finally turned up Stuart Jackson how're you doing Stuart well erm you you're running a res- a restaurant and you run the whole well you're in charge of the whole Junior Mod yesterday so I can understand you're been a busy man this last weekend this weekend right yeah no but it's it's it's a wonderful thing erm erm I I  you know playing these little little little excerpts on the the the children I recorded yesterday there's some great talent out there too erm erm that's great to hear  yeah indeed erm yeah ah great idea yeah yeah yeah absolutely erm
 yeah yeah absolutely yeah yeah us talking of the Mod in general erm is is there a a trend to move away from the old st- erm stylised singing and  and move towards a more traditional style of singing now in the Mod erm yeah yeah biggest attendance I would say yeah yeah yeah erm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah if you have that you know kind of operatic background it'll be very hard to erm it's a a bit like playing instruments you know playing a classical fiddle has to yeah yeah and the west coast absolutely very defined too  yeah yeah absolutely absolutely erm but y- y- your erm to me it was a a very good atmosphere you know the kids were coming up they were very confident too and erm t- t- t- p- particularly just heard the dialogue I don't know how how these kids could really jump into wh- you know erm  yeah yeah y- yeah indeed erm yeah I know yeah yeah absolutely definitely erm mhm yeah I was quite amazed so there's a wee girl I can't remember her name right now and that and she was erm down as fluent and I said did she learn it in the home she's no not at all should the  the erm made the Gaelic medium education she is now considered fluent in the Gaelic she she must have been about eight or nine or something like that mhm erm I see as as a classification yeah yeah erm yeah yeah yeah erm mhm mhm mhm come a long way haven't we since the sixties and seventies mhm right mhm ? mhm yeah yeah mhm yeah would erm well I know my teacher in Ballachulish that's where I started my primary schooling and she was very pro Gaelic Molly ? erm and erm I remember her very well do you know even primary teachers have have a huge impact on pu-  and erm and she actually  somebody told me later on I think an older brother who'd be more aware of what was happening she was breaking all sorts of rules by teaching ? school she'd probably take her chance and erm she just felt strongly about it poor Molly's died in a car crash in Elgin very sad to hear about it but erm she's a a wonderful teacher and she'll always be a young beautiful woman in my memory you know coz that's how I remember her yeah yeah well I do you know you hear about  shortage of teachers erm we'd three classes joined together in the primary that's the way they did it and she was amazing how she would be talking to erm you know one teaching history to one class or something like that ? got an interest any of the younger pupil know the answer and if you had the an- you're always chuffed we had had an answer the older ones didn't know but she was very inclusive she was just bouncing from one class to the other and do you know I don't think I don't think I suffered in any way whatsoever that she mhm mhm mhm yeah yeah yeah erm erm the well erm this a long cry from you know when erm a lady from ? I know very well married her when she went to erm school first of all ? contemporary so few of them were brought up in the old tradition Gaelic was the only language spoken in the house and they didn't have any English and they'd a teacher from the borders they made no concession whatsoever you know so the first  six months or so they were absolute it must have been I've asked Morag about do you know how did she feel about she's a bit confused but she wasn't the only one you see it erm it erm it's erm it's not a wasn't a satisfactory situation I don't think ? no mhm yeah yeah ? yeah erm yeah indeed yes ah aha yeah yeah that's right we're
 that's a- an absolute fact you know particularly in the in the urban areas so you know when there's refugees and all sorts of people mhm I was erm I'm going in a in a tangent here but I always remember the man who opened this radio station up our guest who opened it was erm Ali Ad Abbasi he was  exactly he was erm of Pakistan origin and erm brought up in Glasgow and erm very funny man and erm a r- and he's a delight is he he jumped at the chance to come up here to open the station a wee Portakabin outside and he was more than happy and erm his joke books next door some treasured treasured tome but erm that that was Ali and but erm but y- you see you know Pakistani origin and erm competing at the Mod as we've had in Stornoway too the same thing happening there I I kn- I know it's for instance if I can draw a name out of my list as stuff I've been working on erm there's a young lad there called Isaac Reeves Womble 
 now you that doesn't suggest he's from no no but he was singing there beautifully mhm yeah a- and fond of what he was doing you know yeah amazing of course yes absolutely yeah yeah mhm yeah yeah yeah yeah all right suppose it matters yeah mhm I see yeah yeah mhm it is very difficult I can assure you how's your own Gaelic doing wha- what does that entail then I'm not too bad Andy thanks yes erm had a few loose ends to tie up this morning and erm forgive me for being a wee bit late yes it's it's been erm it's been quite hecti- I mean I got to say you know that that that that the the help I received with with with the Mod was was fantastic there was erm there has been a a Mod Committee in place for for a  for a number of years now erm and erm these ladies they know the whole thing inside out so I erm erm I w- I was guided probably more by them than they were by me erm erm well erm the the big thing that did come out from the Mod was erm all the adjudicators and all the judges all made the same comment you know there is a fantastic amount of talent here erm on the island and erm you know even  the the Gaelic judges if they were doing purely  erm Gaelic language competitions said that the standard of Gaelic was very high erm and and actually c- you know made a point of complementing erm  teachers and and parents as well we can't  forget that the the parents do an awful lot of work at home with with these children so erm you know it erm erm erm it would appear that the the future of Gaelic certainly in Skye is erm in good hands so hopefully erm you know we can we can build on on what we've done this year erm you know we we really want to try
 and erm expand erm the Children's Mod we want to add adult events we're certainly going to add ad- adult events next year erm but erm our our main aim  erm from the whole  erm during the whole procedure is to try erm and improve erm not so much the quality but erm to give the ones who are competing on the national stage a better chance erm through more tuition and and and better adjudications erm erm hopefully we'll be able to to add to the tuition they are already getting you know but that that's a purely financial thing as everything is nowadays you know erm we need at the end of day we need to to generate some some income in order to do that I think in general yes I think there is erm I think erm if you look to the National Mod where the traditional co- erm competitions traditional singing competitions were for erm a long number of years marginalised erm and and now erm to many they're the highlight of of the of the  yes oh absolutely yeah a- absolutely and it's made it erm I mean th- this is a personal view I think that erm some of the Mod com- competitions have been too erm too strict too con- erm  too constricted and and a lot of the singers are finding erm learning and singing in the traditional style a lot more relaxing for them erm I mean base- b- for those erm out there who don't realise erm the difference between the two and y- the conventional gold medal for example there are erm music adjudicators and there are Gaelic adjudicators and the music adjudedicators quite ne- it's quite normal for them not to have erm  much if any Gaelic so they're purely looking at this all from a musical point of view so erm someone who is a fluent Gaelic speaker might not necessarily win because the music might let them down erm so erm in the traditional competitions erm  the mark is purely for Gaelic ? for the overall performance including the Gaelic erm and that to any Gaelic speaker to any Gaelic singer is a much  more relaxed erm way to present your song the the the the the only restriction is of course that you must  learn to sing in the traditional traditional style and and for some very good singers erm they find that very very difficult to to oh yes uhu wh- what you had y- you ask any erm any musician erm and there are styles within styles erm even you know and erm in in in Scotland accordeon players you can you can hear east coast accordeon players and you can hear west coast erm you know and I mea- ve- very very defined and very different yes erm as much the same erm erm even in even in their traditional singing you know the the  the the people who who know more about it will will tell you know that there are distinctive styles within within that as well yes yes erm oh a- yeah absolutely the- there is a confidence I'll I think that that's erm that's  probably down to
 to their schooling you know
 erm they have erm a very confident air they're very comfortable in their own language I mean we tend to forget sometimes that for a lot of these children especially in Skye that Gaelic will be their primary language they 'll speak Gaelic at home and they they now have the facility to speak Gaelic all day at school erm so you know that builds a confidence erm in in their own language that is  erm I mean it erm  it's absolutely brilliant to see I mean we just erm listened to to Ross and Lexie now they're primary one to three you know that that was their class you know and that could've that could  quite easily have been two teenagers talking  you know erm so erm erm  they both they're both stars anyway they're they're they are erm really excellent and again you know that's probably down to to to Mum and Dad and teachers erm and and and all the rest of it erm erm yeah yeah yes well she she probably she probably was erm in a fluent class and Comunn gave us our guidelines you know our governing body give her our guidelines and in Comunn's definition erm as far as children flu- erm erm fluent speakers are if they do go to erm a Gaelic medium then erm it's primary one to three you're still classed as a learner and after that you're classed as a fluent speaker yeah well the the the there were erm anomalies to begin with when when Gaelic medium was was introduced erm some teachers s- still regarded their pupils as learners right up till the f- they went to highschool erm so there had to be there of course there would have been people going to Gaelic medium school who were  fluent speakers before they went so there had to be some distinction drawn and I think it was actually Highland Council drew a distinction between erm beginners and fluent speakers and and now An Comunn have have erm adopted that as well and they ple- erm plus you know when you do have rules and regulations you have to draw a line somewhere and that's that's the that's the place they've they've they've they've chosen to to to to draw that line we have come a l- erm yes erm well I mean I erm I I was in primary school in the sixties and erm erm I I remember well that the our head teacher was  from Harris and and erm our
 erm the wee school teacher as she was called was erm from North Uist erm both fluent Gaelic speakers
 but inside the classroom there was no no speaking of Gaelic but come this time of year when the Mod came on the horizon then we got it all day every day until everybody was erm well-prepared for the Mod and they would go off and and some would win prizes and with the competing choirs and and you know we we would have somebody in every class erm but come the Mod finished then that was the end of it again erm so erm erm it wasn't that erm it was particularly discouraged they just didn't do it erm erm but I know there were places where it was   you know erm yeah yeah erm oh yes erm erm yes all right erm she probably was yeah yeah yeah  yeah oh dear erm erm yes yes yes  erm I mean that we- will th- the you know you're probably in the same boat as I was that you know the the teachers weren't anonymous people you know they were part of the community and and you saw them everyday and and erm you know erm erm erm yeah yeah erm erm yes yes erm no I'm admi- it must have been very difficult for her I don't we were exactly the same erm we had there was two schools there was the big school and the wee school and I think erm there was probably fifth sixth and sorry  a primary five six and seven were in the big school and and all the younger kids were in the wee school erm but it it was you know it was one big classroom erm and erm they they had to tell all othe- all other curriculum as they walked round the room yes yes yeah erm yes yeah yeah yeah yeah erm erm yeah yeah it must have been ex- must have been extremely difficult yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no erm erm I'm-erm it's it's not and and you wonder erm that nowadays you know  you know we're erm a motivational society now and and I think erm I would imagine that there'll be a lot more consideration given now to erm people who came to school or children who came to school without English as a first language than there was back in back in in our day yeah yeah yeah yeah erm yes yeah yes erm it's it- it-  it's erm I I think you know the c- the considary- consideration given to them wou- wou- be be would be erm you know vastly superior to what what Gaelic was given back in the  oh yes yeah he used to compete at the Mod yes yeah yeah that's right he was he was yeah yes yes yes yes you you wouldn't you wouldn't imagine no and you wouldn't imagine that he's got erm Highland genealogy there at all yes actually I I I I was I was  chairing the the competition  that that erm erm Isaac sang in and and he had a lovely voice and obviously you know he was well-tutored erm and fond of what he was doing erm y- erm erm it's quite funny when you when you when you're erm when people are passing in and out the particular room that you're you're you're working in for the day you know and you hear all the different accents and erm you know from from the parents and fr- and from the from the kids and there was erm American accents there's Canadian accents there was erm Irish accents erm but erm you know but then Scotland there's Aberdonians Glaswegians Invernesians y- y- erm and erm  erm it's great to see not only you know the indigenous population here  who you would expect to have erm a- at least a passing interest in in in the language and th- and the music but when you see the other erm erm people from other parts of Scotland indeed from other parts of the world erm showing an interest and in in in one case
 now I don't want to cause any arguments but you see either Canadian or American and my erm my linguistic skills weren't good enough to to split which he country he came from but erm his son was was erm  was performing and he was speaking to his son in Gaelic so he'd obviously made the ef- effort to learn the language as well which was you know which is brilliant erm erm they and and hats off to him coz it erm erm erm I mean it it is a difficult language erm to to to to learn it erm grammatically it's it's it's improving it's improving I I tell you after doing this
 programme erm the the the Mod programme and writing out all these names well certainly my Gaelic spelling's improved an awful lot but erm no it it it it's moving on erm reasonably  ly- reasonably well I would hope to try an- an- and erm take a fluent ? erm sometime maybe at the end of this year beginning the next year
