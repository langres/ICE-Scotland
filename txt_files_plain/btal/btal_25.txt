and my name is John Scott 
and as Deputy Presiding Officer 
it 's my pleasure 
to welcome you 
to the Scottish parliament tonight 
and 
to the grand final 
of the two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fourteen 
Donald Dewar 
memorial debating tournament 
I am delighted 
to be chairing 
this prestigious event 
once again 
the Dewar debate is indeed a highlight 
in the parliamentary calendar 
and having presided 
over proceedings in this chamber throughout the week 
I 'm greatly looking forward to hearing the arguments and ideas 
of our younger 
speakers 
this evening 
a hundred and twenty eight teams representing schools from around the country 
set out on the road to Holyrood in November 
last year 
thirty two first round heats 
sixteen second round heats 
and four semi-finals 
have whittled down the field 
to the four 
talented teams 
who 'll be competing 
in this evening 's 
grand final 
and my congratulations 
to the finalists 
who I will introduce shortly 
and to the other 
six teams 
who will also 
who are also 
in seats in the chamber 
and they will have the opportunity 
to participate in the open floor debates 
during the course 
of the proceedings 
this competition 
is superbly organised 
by the Law Society of Scotland 
and I offer my thanks to everyone 
from the society 
for all their hard work 
and their efforts in this regard 
I 'd also like to thank the tournament sponsors 
Hodder Gibson 
publishers 
and the Glasgow Bar Association 
for their 
much valued 
support 
and following the untimely death 
of Donald Dewar 
Scotland 's 
first 
First Minister 
in the early years of this parliament 
this debating tournament 
was dedicated 
to Donald 's memory 
Donald Dewar 
was himself a student 
of history and law 
and practised as a solicitor 
in between stints as a member of the House of Commons 
where he represented seats in Aberdeen 
and Glasgow 
Donald was also a member of the Glasgow University dialectic society 
and was a frequent participant 
in its debates 
alongside 
his many well-known contemporaries 
Donald retained his passion for debating right through his political career in the House of Commons 
and in the very early days of this parliament 
and in his maiden speech 
in the new 
Scottish parliament 
Donald stated 
today 
there is 
a new voice in the land 
the voice 
of a democratic parliament 
a voice 
to shape Scotland 
a voice 
for the future 
so it 's fitting therefore 
that occupying the seats 
of our parliamentarians tonight 
are potentially 
the lawmakers 
the politicians 
the lawyers 
of the future 
and it 's also fitting 
that this chamber continues to reverberate 
to the sound 
of a new generation 
of debators 
through this 
annual competition 
finally 
joining us in the public gallery this evening 
are many 
proud parents 
classmates 
and teachers 
and it 's wonderful 
to see 
all of you here tonight 
as well 
and I hope you 
enjoy 
your evening 
here 
at Holyrood 
I wish all the finalists 
the very best of luck 
and I hope you all 
have an enjoyable 
evening here 
in your 
Scottish parliament 
thanks very much
