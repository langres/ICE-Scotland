Presiding Officer 
my Lords Ladies 
gentlemen 
distinguished guests 
fellow 
medalists 
I 'm truly 
honoured to be among such distinguished company today 
and thank you to all of the Carnegie 
Trusts 
for this incredible award 
I really do n't believe there 's a prouder man 
in Scotland 
today 
I 'm absolutely 
chuffed to bits 
in truth 
I 'm only here 
thanks to the fantastic guidance of two 
wonderful men 
one 
my father 
who taught me from an early age 
that I had an obligation 
to give at least as much back 
to this world 
that 
it had given me 
the second 
President Vartan Gregorian 
if I can take you back to nineteen ninety eight 
I had just sold my business 
the one that started in the back of the van 
for a great deal of money 
so I had a very large cheque in the bank 
but I had no idea what to do 
I was thirty seven years old 
I had heard of Carnegie 
but not at school 
and my plea to this 
Parliament today 
is let 's 
teach 
Carnegie 's 
fantastic story 
to our future generations 
and in that way 
inspire them to go on and be wealth creators 
and hopefully 
philanthropists 
please 
let 's do it 
because I became inspired 
and I wanted to learn more about 
Andrew Carnegie 
so I got on a plane 
I went to the United States 
and I knocked on the door 
of the Carnegie Corporation of New York 
can I see the President 
do you have an appointment 
no 
but I 've got time 
and I can wait 
President Gregorian 
did n't keep me waiting 
too long 
what happened next 
was the most important meeting 
I have ever had 
in my philanthropic 
journey 
Vartan 
patiently 
listened to my story 
then explained to me 
that this great wealth I now had 
was in fact 
not mine 
I was merely a custodian 
and I had to figure out 
how I was going to invest this wealth 
for the common good 
I thought 
he was stark 
raving 
mad 
I 'd worked 
eighteen hours a day 
seven days a week for fourteen years 
I had lost all my hair 
and he said it was n't mine 
so we chatted some more 
and I left 
confused 
but I kept coming back 
to his words 
and I slowly 
began to get it 
and today Vartan 
I really get it 
I understand what you and Andrew Carnegie were saying 
that once you 've taken care of your family 
then put your wealth 
to work 
for the common good 
I get it 
and I would add 
do it 
while you 're still 
alive 
because one 
it 's great fun 
why wait till you 're dead 
and give someone else 
all the fun 
and the fulfilment we get 
investing through our foundation 
gives a bigger buzz 
and greater happiness 
than any business deal I 've ever done 
can money 
buy you happiness 
I 'm often asked 
yes 
absolutely 
if you give it 
for the common good 
I 'm delighted my family 
are here 
to share today 
my sister Janice 
Ewan 
our foundation CEO 
could n't do it without you 
my wonderful wife Marion 
who keeps my feet 
firmly 
on the ground 
and has almost single-handedly brought up 
our three 
wonderful children 
Jaimie 
Adam 
and Amy 
and kids 
thank you for your understanding 
that you wo n't inherit 
great wealth 
but you can pursu- 
pursue 
your dreams 
and pursue 
your own passion 
as long as they 're legal of course 
our true wealth 
is not in how much we give 
but how much we do for our fellow man 
I really believe that 
and we live 
in an interdependent world 
and here 's how crazy that inter- 
interdependent world can look 
the World Health Organisation tells us 
that if you live 
in a leafy 
up-market suburb of Glasgow 
called Lenzie 
the male life expectancy is eighty two years old 
eight miles from Lenzie 
down the road 
in Calton 
male 
life expectancy 
drops 
to fifty four years 
this is inequitable 
and actually an act of barbarism 
in the truest sense 
we need to fix this 
and we 're going to 
for Calton you can read the developing world too 
we also need to help 
the people there 
fix that 
but not in the manner 
some believe 
we 're not colonisers 
and we should not act as colonisers 
Africa 
knows its problems and its solutions 
our role should be as enablers 
not determiners 
we believe people need 
a hand up 
and not 
a handout 
and importantly 
we need to treat causes 
not fund the sticking plasters 
philanthropy is an incredible power for good 
but we need to lead 
we need to disrupt we need to challenge the norm 
take the risks 
do what others fear to do 
but never 
ever 
fear failure 
itself 
partner 
not pander to governments 
NGOs the third sector 
challenge create 
catalyse change 
for the common good 
we are all 
born equal 
we will all die 
equal 
and we should all share 
equal opportunity 
in between 
Carnegie marked his life out 
by trying to change the world 
for the common good 
it may have been one step 
on a thousand mile journey 
but it 's a journey 
we should all 
be on 
a journey 
for 
equity equality and emancipation 
from the shackles of poverty
