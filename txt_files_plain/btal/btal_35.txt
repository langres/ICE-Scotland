firstly as usual like to sincerely thank all of those who signed the motion and I particularly thank those who stayed behind to listen to the debate today and to take part World Leprosy Day is a major date in the calender for those fighting the scourge of humanity that is leprosy every year on the last Sunday in January in some countries that lasts a whole week the whole world has a chance to stop and consider the plight of those people who are affected by leprosy around the globe it's also an opportunity to take stock to celebrate the many stories of hope transformation and restoration that have been achieved by the Leprosy Commission of course many other organisations particularly the churches are also involved alongside the Leprosy Mission in dedicating themselves to the same ultimate goal of eradicating leprosy from the planet and thus transforming people's lives but it is also an important opportunity to grapple with the scale of the problem that depressingly still exists around the world and the impact this has on individuals and communities this year World Leprosy Day will be on Sunday the thirty first of January now I've had the pleasure of visiting the Leprosy Mission Scotland's office in my constituency on many occasions during my time as an MSP and the staff and volunteers there do a remarkable job believe some of them we will be in the gallery and I can see them here today and I welcome them to the Scottish parliament erm most recently I had the pleasure of visiting their office at Livilands at the beginning of November when the Minister himself paid an official visit now not only was that visit fun and enjoyable occasion but we were provided with a very detailed briefing on their most recent projects including the fantastic work they are doing in Dhaka in two thousand and thirteen the Leprosy Mission Scotland received just under three hundred thousand pounds of Scottish Government funding to help with the rehabilitation project in Dhaka and Bangladesh the aim of the project to provide an improved quality of life for people with leprosy and people with low-rated physical disabilities all rightly with a focus particularly on women the plan to set up self-help groups for people with disabilities where they can be given training in income-generation activities they also intend to help develop individuals' and communities' capacity to a better access to rights and entitlements to health services and improve access to education for their children the Leprosy Mission Scotland has been helping people across the world since eighteen seventy four providing education s- support to those affected by the disease the mission has had around two hundred projects across thirty countries mainly in Africa Asia and around the Pacific bringing healing and much-needed justice to people affected by leprosy and the Leprosy Mission Scotland now has agreed that for the next three years most if not all of the support raised in Scotland will specifically go to help people affected by leprosy in seven countries that's Angola Bangladesh India Myanmar Nepal Nigeria and South Sudan and it was great to go along and see the fabulous work done by Linda Todd the chief executive and her remarkable team of staff and volunteers they're doing there on a daily basis at the Leprosy Mission Scotland and as you might imagine leprosy is a disease which is commonly comes from places of poverty dirty surroundings overcrowding poor nutrition housing and sanitation all make people more susceptible to the leprosy infection thankfully however over ninety five percent of people are naturally resistant to the disease but let's remind ourselves of the sheer scale of the challenge they're grappling with across the world every day between six hundred and seven hundred people are diagnosed with leprosy that's an incredible one person every two minutes and the disease is still prevalent in nineteen countries but more than half of those are affected are still in India however it's not all bad news because dur- over the last twenty years more than fourteen million people have been cured of leprosy and the disease has been eliminated from over one hundred countries leprosy can be cured an early diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy for a period of six to twelve months can prevent physical and psychological problems escalating but as well as medicines and surgery those with complex cases may require therapy rehabilitation vocational training housing options and much much more for thousands of years leprosy has been a source of fear and outrage in many countries leprosy is still seen as a taboo topic sadly there are still simply too many stories about how people have been disowned by their partners or family and cast out of their communities because of a lack of knowledge and fear surrounding the disease fear persecution prejudice in many communities mean that people affected by leprosy don't just have to cope with the effects of the disease itself they often have to face stigma persecution and injustice making life doubly difficult but injustice can come in many forms and it varies widely from place to place from country to country so m- removing the stigma attached to the disease not only helps to encourage those affected to seek treatment but also helps their families and the wider community understand much more about the illness that's why the Leprosy Mission Scotland's efforts in the education field are so vitally important they're working exceptionally hard at tackling misunderstanding and stigma associated with leprosy the mission continues to very clearly demonstrate compassion dedication and enthusiasm to their ultimate goal of defeating leprosy worldwide now my own personal attention to the whole issue of leprosy came actually in primary six when a great old teacher of mine told us about the story of Mary Slessor erm from Aberdeen who was call- who eventually became known as the white queen of Calabar and she did had done so much work on leprosy at that time and I remember the impact that had on me at primary six so that's why I was so pleased to take part in this debate today and I know all of the people in this parliament will hope with all their being that the Leprosy Mission are successful just as human- humanly possible in eradicating the disease it is entirely possible to end this scourge on humanity it just needs common effort and will to make it happen thank you
