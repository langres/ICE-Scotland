thank you Presiding Officer for inviting me to lead Time For Reflection 
a week past Sunday 
was Easter Sunday a very important celebration for Christians 
around the world 
as we celebrated Jesus ' resurrection 
and for my congregation 
Easter Sunday tends to present them with something a little unexpected 
over the past few years I 've rearranged the seatings where everyone faced the side wall 
I 've had the congregation sit in a huge circle so everyone was facing each other 
I 've crossed a cream egg 
in front of them 
and I 've bounced an egg 
off the communion table 
and I do these things to be 
unpredictable 
after all nothing was 
as the disciples and the women expected on that first Easter morning 
they went to Jesus ' grave expecting to find his body inside with a stone rolled in front of the entrance 
but that 's not what they found 
and understandably they were very confused 
after all the unexpected and the unimaginable had happened 
Jesus had risen from the grave 
and while on Easter Sunday I try to make things different or do the unexpected in my church 
I can never fully recreate the feelings that Jesus ' followers must have had 
when they discovered the empty tomb 
but what I can do 
is let my congregation experience the unexpected in a small way 
because as we go through life it 's rare for things to always pan out 
the way we expect them to 
at some point we all face the unexpected 
because life is n't predictable 
and we should never assume that things will always go our way 
and that lesson of not assuming things applies to us all 
as we live our lives 
we should never assume to know 
what people are thinking 
or how they 're feeling 
we should treat everyone 
with respect 
as Jesus said 
love your neighbour 
as yourself 
meaning that we should treat people the way we want to be treated 
and of course that includes listening 
to what they 're actually saying 
not assuming that we know best 
as MSPs I 'm sure you are all aware of the importance of stopping to listen 
and actually hear 
what 's being said 
however my prayer 
is as well as listening to your constituents 
you 'll also listen to God 
because that way 
whether the expected 
or the unexpected happens 
you 'll be ready to respond in his strength 
and continue 
serving the people of Scotland 
thank you
