during 
the second term of President Reagan 's 
administration in the United States 
of America 
William Bennett 
Reagan 's Secretary of State for Education 
publicly complained 
that the people who really ruled the United States were not the current occupants of the White House 
but Liberals 
and their cronies 
who consistently displayed a disdain 
for the Judeo-Christian values that had made America great 
the political commentator 
Rick Hertzberg 
the son of an unbelieving Jewish father and a Quaker mother 
fired off 
this reply 
in the New Yorker Magazine 
as a Judeo-Christian who has an aversion to religion 
and who 's as 
a 
who who 's an American as good as or better than any mouse-haired 
Bible-touting 
apartheid-promoting evangelist 
on any UHF television station you can name 
I must protest 
where was it written 
that if you do n't like religion 
you are somehow disqualified from being a legitimate American 
what was Mark Twain 
a Russian 
when did it become 
un-American to have opinions 
about the origin and meaning of the universe that come from sources 
other than the body of dogma 
of organisations approved by the federal government 
as certifiably 
Judeo-Christian 
if it 's American to believe 
that God ordered tribe X to abjure pork 
or that he caused 
leader Y to be born to a virgin 
why is it suddenly un-American to doubt 
that the prime mover of this unimaginably vast universe 
of quintillions 
of solar systems 
would be likely to be obsessed with questions 
involving the dietary 
and biosexual behaviour 
of a few thousand bipeds 
inhabiting a small part 
of a speck of dust 
orbiting a third-rate star 
in an obscure spiral arm 
of one of a million galaxies 
end of quote 
and that 's a 
quote with chuzpa 
I want to offer two 
words in response to that eloquent outburst and my first word is Amen 
Amen because like Rick Hertzberg 
I object to the way 
some religious leaders rate their sacred text above all other texts on earth 
as carriers of knowledge and wisdom 
so I say 
Amen 
to Rick Hertzberg 's 
protest at religious arrogance 
and its tendency to think its values 
are the only values available to us 
but my second word has to be 
nevertheless 
because it is by means 
of these few thousand bipeds called homo sapiens 
that this universe 
is thinking about itself 
and has become aware of its own existence 
there may be self-conscious 
rational creatures 
in other corners of the universe 
but we are the only ones we know about 
and it seems to have taken 
the universe fourteen billion years for us to appear 
well the universe may not be in a hurry to explain 
and understand itself but we are 
since we arrived on the scene about fifty thousand years ago 
mentally ready and raring to go 
our knowledge of reality has increased so rapidly 
that I 'm tempted to think that next to light itself 
the human mind 
is the fastest thing in the universe 
here 's a poem 
that captures the wonder of it all 
by 
Primo Levi 
a survivor of the Holocaust a chemist 
a humanist 
a poet 
who carried the pain 
of the twentieth century 
into his own suicide 
fellow humans 
to whom a year is a long time 
a sanctuary a venerable goal 
struggling for your bread 
tired 
threatful tricked 
sick 
lost 
listen 
and may it be mockery and 
consolation 
twenty billion years before now 
brilliant 
soaring in space and time 
there was a ball of flame 
solitary 
eternal 
our common father 
and our executioner 
it exploded 
and every change began 
even now the thin echo of this one reverse catastrophe 
resounds from the father 's reaches 
from that one spasm everything was born 
the same abyss that enfolds and challenges us 
the same time that spawns and defeats us 
everything 
anyone has ever thought 
the eyes of every woman we have loved 
suns by the thousands 
and this hand 
that writes 
and this hand 
that writes 
that 's what I want to think about this evening 
the astonishing creativity 
of the human animal 
flowing from the big brains 
that have evolved in us to be instruments 
of communication 
and transformation 
it is from our minds 
and their desire to understand existence 
that religion 
and science 
and 
philosophy have emerged 
but this evening 
I want to concentrate on another aspect of our fertile minds 
human art 
and culture 
culture has been defined as any 
widespread behaviour 
that is transmitted by learning 
rather than acquired by inheritance 
and on this planet it is unique to us 
we are the creative animal 
you wo n't find 
a bunch of other animals 
dedicated to listening to a boring lecture anywhere else on the planet this evening 
no 
colloquies of camels meeting to discuss the nature of camelhood 
but here we are 
and we do it all the time because we are the 
creative animal the thinking animal 
the animal that 's an object of interest to itself 
and 
the universe 
is an object of interest to itself 
at the root 
of our ability 
to create culture 
I believe 
is the problem we have with time 
and its companion 
boredom 
just think of a few of the ways we talk 
about time 
passing time 
filling time 
redeeming time 
doing 
time 
and you do n't 
just have to be a prisoner to understand the boredom of that 
kind of stretch of time 
it seems 
to us 
the creative animal 
that once the necessities of life are more or less povided for 
the human 
animal has a problem with time and what to do with it 
and what we 've done with it 
is to fill it with imaginative inventions 
that become more and more complex and absorbing 
and sometimes they are astonishingly beautiful 
this is the impulse 
that gives us everything from Sudoku 
to symphonies 
literary masterpieces 
and television soap operas 
and even that strange Scottish pastime 
hitting a wee white ball into the face of a force ten gale 
and claiming to enjoy it 
golf 
we do these things watch people on a train you 've got five hours to go from 
Waverley to King 's Cross 
people are reading 
they 're doing crosswords 
they 're doing their emails they 're shouting into their phones 
the one thing they do n't do is nothing 
because time 
has to be filled 
time stretches it troubles us 
if we 're 
on our own with nothing to do 
if trying to distract ourselves 
from the boredom 
of plodding time 
is one of the roots of art 
then another is even more surprising 
art is one of the ways in which the troubled or despised 
have sought to console 
and understand themselves 
the novelist Rebecca West claimed 
that artistic genius 
was 
and this phrase is in quotes the abnormal justifying itself 
end of quote 
and she went on 
those who know 
that they are for whatever reason condemned by the laws of life 
make themselves one with life by some 
magnificent act of creation 
I found those 
words from 
Rebecca West 
in Victoria Glenndinning 's 
wonderful biography of Vita 
Sackville 
-West 
the wife of Harold Nicolson 
Glenndinning applied them to Vita herself 
and suggested 
that her magnificent act of creation 
was neither her poetry nor her fiction 
but the garden that she created at Sissinghurst 
Castle in Kent 
if you 've ever been to that garden you 'll remember what a wonder it is this is how her son 
Nigel describes it 
Harold 
made the design 
Vita 
did the planting 
in the firm perspective of Vista 's 
one can trace his classical hand 
in the overflowing clematis 
figs vines and wisteria 
in the rejection of violent colour 
or anything too tame or orderly 
one discovers her 
romanticism 
wild flowers must be allowed to invade the garden 
if plants stray over a path 
they must not be cut back 
the visitor must duck 
rhododendrons must be banished in favour of their tender cousin 
the azalea 
roses must not electrify 
but seduce 
and when a season has produced its best 
that part of the garden must be allowed to lie fallow 
for another year 
since there is a cycle in nature that must not be disguised 
it is eternally renewable 
like a play 
with acts and scenes 
there can be a change of cast 
but the script 
remains the same 
permanence 
and mutation 
are the secrets 
of this garden 
when West 
described artists 
as being condemned by 
the laws of life 
she was not of course talking 
about the ways of nature so lovingly celebrated by Vita 
in her garden 
but of those man-made laws we call 
custom 
or morality 
Glendinning 
applied this insight to Vita 's homosexuality 
if you are told by church and society 
that what you are in your very essence is wrong 
it will create 
a dissonance 
a disjunction 
between your own soul 
and the norms of the community 
that surrounds you 
Rebecca West is saying 
that creativity 
has one of its roots 
in that 
disconnection 
between prevailing attitudes and the reality 
of the maker 's life 
that dissonance she suggests 
is the grit in the soul 
that becomes 
the pearl of great price 
wonderful art 
of course the flipside of that process is revealed 
when social change swaps curse for blessing 
and the outlaw 
is brought in from the cold 
a good example of this 
reverse dynamic is provided by the career 
of the playwright Terence Rattigan 
who 's been having a bit of a 
a revival recently 
in the West End in London 
Rattigan 's biographer Michael Darlow pinpointed the problem 
that started to confront all homosexual writers in Britain 
when the theatre began to change in the nineteen sixties 
this is what he wrote 
until the late nineteen fifties 
Rattigan 's art 
as a dramatist depended upon the oblique 
the implicit 
the struggle of frightened damaged people to find self- 
expression and fulfilment 
in a society 
whose strict moral codes had always inhibited them 
that 's why 
a lot of 
gay writers wrote in a kind of code 
but once those moral codes began to be relaxed 
Rattigan 
was not only out of fashion 
he was stranded 
not only 
his technique as a writer 
but his background and lifetime 's conditioning 
meant 
that however passionately he res- 
he resented the old hypocrisies 
he was not equipped to make do without them 
because they 
were the way he made art 
the result was 
that when he tried to confront sex however frankly and sincerely 
in the permissive atmosphere 
of the post-Osborne theatre 
he always seemed evasive 
insincere 
and sometimes actually embarrassing 
I sometimes also reflect on another group 
of 
distinctively gay artists who 
used their 
homosexuality 
as a code 
a lot of famous radio comics 
spoke to each other 
in a kind of code 
that a lot of homophobic people adored not knowing 
what the language was actually about 
this is 
Rebecca West 
the abnormal 
the marginalised justifying themselves making art out of their pain 
I want to conclude this 
section of my thesis 
with a poignant footnote that takes us back across the Atlantic 
one of the most remarkable illustrations of Rebecca West 's claim 
that great art 
comes from 
the makers ' attempt to bring sense and meaning out of rejection and oppression 
has to be the music that came from 
African-American slaves 
in the United 
States 
think of the longing 
and pain 
in those famous Negro spirituals 
and the way their music 
transfigured anguish into art they make you cry the very thought of them 
one way to connect 
with that tradition 
is through Michael Tippett 's oratorio 
A Child of Our Time 
in which the great spirituals 
are like the passionate chorals of 
Bach 
used to capture and transcend human suffering 
nobody knows the trouble I 've seen steal away 
steal away 
steal away to Jesus 
you can 
you can feel the pain of those people enslaved 
thousands of miles away from their own homeland their hearts broken 
making art 
out of torment 
if you want another image to 
hold this particular enormity 
that 
was transcended into beauty 
then think of the great persecuted African-American singer 
Paul Robeson 
I have an image of him 
must have been from a movie 
standing 
in the chains of slavery 
singing 
Ol' Man River 
that 's a famous song 
he envied the river 
you and I 
he 's singing to the other slaves we 
we sweat and we 're in pain but Ol' Man River he just keeps rolling 
rolling on 
and it summed up 
the agony 
in that instant of beauty 
pain transfigured into great art
