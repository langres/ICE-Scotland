Presiding Officer 
the 
Scottish government believes that decisions affecting the lives of 
people in Scotland 
should be taken here in Scotland 
to reflect the priorities and views of those who choose 
to live and to work 
in this country 
that is why we campaigned for the establishment of the Scottish parliament 
why we voted for the Scotland Act in nineteen ninety eight 
and why we supported the Scotland Act 
in twenty twelve 
it is why we campaigned for 
and believe in 
Scottish independence 
and it is also 
why we took part in the process 
of the Smith Commission 
in the light of the referendum result 
the government produced proposals for further devolution 
on the tenth of October 
arguing for a robust package of powers 
of further powers 
for this parliament 
as a participant 
in the proceedings 
and on behalf of the Scottish government 
I want to record our thanks to Lord Smith 
of Kelvin 
for his clear 
focussed 
and neutral direction 
of the Commission 's proceedings 
I 'm also grateful to the secretariate of the Commission 
made up of officials from the United Kingdom and the Scottish governments 
and also of this parliament 
for their hard work in supporting the process 
I also thank other members of the Commission 
for the generally 
good-natured approach 
taken to the process 
the Commission 
had a challenging task 
the promises made to the people of Scotland in the lead-up to the referendum 
of Home Rule 
and near-federalism 
and extensive powers for this parliament 
made that expectations around this process 
were extremely high 
four hundred and seven organisations 
and over eighteen thousand individuals in Scotland 
took the time to write to the Smith Commission 
setting out their views on further devolution 
this clearly demonstrates that engagement and interest in politics in Scotland 
remains as strong 
as during the referendum 
on behalf of the Scottish government 
I welcome the contents of the report 
but I regret 
that a wider range of powers 
have not been 
devolved 
the report contains a number of recommendations 
that will enable this parliament to better serve the people of Scotland 
devolution of air passenger duty 
in particular is a responsibility for which we have been calling for some time 
and was first alongside 
the devolution of the aggregate 's levy 
proposed by the Calman Commission in two thousand and nine 
it is a tax which impacts on our tourism industry 
and the wider business sector 
more extensive powers over income tax 
albeit within the reserved framework set by Westminster 
opens up new opportunities to this parliament 
and will increase accountability 
the flexibility over all rates and bands 
except the personal loans 
is an improvement on the narrow and inflexible power 
for a Scottish rate of income tax 
that we are in the process 
of implementing 
the devolution of some benefits for disabled people 
carers and our elderly 
will enable us to develop more effective approaches 
to support the most vulnerable people 
in our communities 
the experience of the bedroom tax 
has shown us the risks of Westminster taking the decisions 
for the whole of the UK 
on a one s- 
a one-size-fits-all basis 
ignoring the realities of circumstances here in Scotland 
the proposal to vary the housing element of universal credit 
will enable us to prevent that happening in the future 
subject to this parliament 's ability 
to find the required resources 
we now also have the prospect of being able to create new benefits 
which could assist our people 
the long overdue agreement to transfer to this parliament 
responsibilities and revenues of the crown estate 
to two hundred nautical miles 
is a proposal that has had long standing support across the parties 
with these powers 
we will be able to ensure 
island and coastal communities 
receive one hundred percent 
of the net income from sea bed leasing revenues 
ensure there is a coherent system fo- of support for our renewables industry 
and enable greater investment in a wide variety of projects 
ranging from harbour improvements 
to community tourism projects 
the Islands minister is beginning discussions on the use of these powers 
in Orkney today 
finally and I 'm sure everyone in this chamber 
will welcome the fact that this parliament will have control over our own elections 
this parliament has more than demonstrated its competence 
in delivering fair and robust constitutional processes 
I 'm particularly pleased 
that we secured agreement on the need for early action to allow us to extend 
the franchise to sixteen and seventeen year-olds 
for the twenty sixteen election 
following 
following the publication of the report 
the government wants to make rapid progress in implementing these recommendations 
in full and in tru- in in true 
to the spirit and the intention 
of the Smith report 
to make that progress successfully there are a number of principles that should be observed 
firstly 
we believe the UK and Scottish governments must work jointly in producing the draft clauses due to be published by end of January 
the First Minister wrote to the Prime Minister on the day the report was published 
to offer the Scottish government 's full participation 
and the point about this 
is that we have just had an experience 
in the Smith Commission 
where a joint secretariate representing 
or composed of 
members of the civil service of the United Kingdom government 
of the Scottish government 
and also parliamentary staff from this institution 
have been able to effectively 
and properly support 
the Commission 
it would seem logical to extend that approach 
to include also 
the drafting of the relevant clauses to put into practice 
the commitments 
of the Smith Commission 
the second principle 
is that where possible both governments should take early action on devolution 
and in tackling key areas of concern 
the most pressing 
is early action to secure the powers for this parliament 
to enfranchise sixteen and seventeen year-olds 
as this government would like to do and this is supported across the political spectrum 
in this parliament 
in time for the twenty sixteen election 
i- 
all of us 
have watched 
the 
tremendous success 
of the extension of the franchise to sixteen and seventeen year-olds 
during the referendum which was a model 
of democratic participation 
and democratic 
engagement 
and 
it is essential 
that 
the commitments that were made 
to sixteen and seventeen year-olds 
in the referendum 
are extended to ensure their participation 
in the elections to this parliament 
in twenty sixteen 
the First Minister repeated the Commission 's call for early action 
in 
on the issue of sixteen and seventeen year-old representation 
in her letter to the Prime Minister last week 
and I 'm sure this whole parliament is hopeful 
of a positive response 
to that 
proposition 
similarly early legislative action could be taken to devolve air passenger duty 
the twenty twelve Scotland Act provides an order-making power 
to add new devolved taxes to the land and buildings transaction tax 
and the landfil tax which we are now 
currently implementing 
early action could also be taken on gender quotas 
in her previous ministerial role 
Shona Robison wrote to the UK government outlining the Scottish government 's proposals 
for a section thirty order to provide this parliament 
with the necessary competence 
we must make progress down that route 
paragraph ninety six of the Smith Commission report lists 
a number of important issues for consideration 
that do not require an active devolution 
these include important issues around immigration to support our economy 
asylum seekers victims of human trafficking 
retention of fine income in Scotland 
and also 
in relation to health and safety 
my cabinet colleagues and I will be writing to our UK counterparts seeking early discussions 
on these matters over the next few days 
progress on these powers would be an early down payment on the further devolution 
we have all been promised 
and will be a key test 
of the UK government 's commitment 
my third principle 
is that the UK and Scottish governments should start preparing in good faith for the transfer of the powers identified in Lord Smith 's report 
in particular the United Kingdom government should take 
should not take any steps 
or decisions 
that would significantly affect the position of this parliament after devolution 
or constrain our freedom to come to our own decisions 
without our expressed agreement 
the most obvious example of this 
is the move from disability living allowance 
to personal independence payments that the First Minister mentioned 
in this chamber last week 
the First Minister will be writing to the Prime Minister asking 
that the rule out of personal independence payments 
should be halted in Scotland 
and that the proposed cuts to disability benefits are not implemented 
before the responsibility is passed to this parliament 
I hope all members in this chamber 
will support that position 
another example of the employment programme such as the work programme 
the current contracts for these are approaching their end 
it is crucial 
that the UK and Scottish governments agree the arrangements that will follow these contracts 
and we should explore 
all the options including the devolution of responsibility to this parliament 
as soon as 
is practical 
of particular importance is agreement that more powers are accompanied 
by firm financial foundations 
and a fiscal framework that provides an equitable settlement 
to both governments 
experience of the ongoing negotiation 
and implementation around the Scotland Act twenty twelve 
which I discussed at length with the finance committee yesterday in their evidence hearing session 
in 
on the Isle of Arran 
has shown the implementation of financial agreements 
is almost as important 
as the legislation itself 
in my letter to the Chancellor on the autumn statement 
I therefore propose that we meet in short order 
to start discussions on how these aspects of Lord Smith 's recommendations 
will be implemented 
there is a long way to go before the Smith C- 
recommendations are delivered for Scotland 
but I believe we will have the best chance of fulfilling its commitments 
if we follow these principles 
joint working between the UK and Scottish governments 
early actions where possible 
and both governments preparing in good faith 
for the transfer to take place 
this is not a process that can or should be confined to governments 
participation was one of the themes 
of the First Minister 's comments 
on our programme for government last week 
and participation and engagement have been watchwords for Scottish politics 
since the extraordinary experience 
of the referendum 
at the start of the Smith process we engaged with groups of stakeholders 
to shape our proposals for more powers 
and our approach to the Commission 's work 
the STUC supported devolution of employment law 
health and safety 
trade union law and the minimum wage 
the STUC also advanced amendments to immigration legislation 
so that the Scottish government would be able to direct immigration policy 
as it affects Scotland 
the Institute of Directors suggested variable capital allowances 
to promote localised investment particularly into businesses in challenged areas 
and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry 
called for RND incentives to improve Scotland 's poor industrial record 
in this area 
Children First 
supported powers over all aspects of employment rights 
and conditions to create a much more family-friendly employment regime 
they also supported 
devolution of child support 
the Scottish council for voluntary organisations supported devolving the full package of powers over welfare 
to create a welfare system that puts fairness 
and supporting people at its heart 
and the full devolution of equality law 
the full devolution of equalities legislation 
was supported by Engender 
and other equalities groups 
and it should therefore be of little surprise 
that given that none of these responsibilities were devolved 
there was such widespread disappointment 
on the publication of the report last week 
the proposals 
the proposals mean 
the proposals mean that control over seventy one percent of taxes in Scotland remains at Westminster 
along with eighty five percent of welfare decisions 
including the conditions and the sanctions 
that are causing so much distress 
in our country 
these proposals 
can not be characterised 
as Home Rule 
or as near federalism 
as is possible 
in the United Kingdom 
the vow 
has 
quite simply 
not 
been 
fulfilled 
whilst 
whilst the Commission may not have given us all the tools we want 
and for which we will continue to argue 
we 
in the Scottish government stand ready to play our part 
and we now look forward to the next steps 
in Scotland 's journey
