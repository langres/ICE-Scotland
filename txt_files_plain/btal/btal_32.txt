Presiding Officer and members of the Scottish parliament thank you for this opportunity to come and speak to you today the Bible says we are God's masterpiece he's created us anew in Christ Jesus so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago in our busy lives we need to take time to look at God's wonderful creation in my work with Prospex I travel all around Scotland our country's awe-inspiring in its diversity of landscapes and in autumn the colours of the leaves are spectacular green yellow red brown and orange and so many shades of each as you look at the trees growing together we notice that they're all different shapes and sizes with leaves distinctive and varied but blending together to achieve a spectacular masterpiece of beauty and colour in the Bible we're reminded in that book of Ephesians that we are God's masterpiece and that of course includes people with learning disabilities when we view ourselves and others as God's masterpiece his best work we start to realise that there are no unimportant people each person has equal value to God loved and created just the way he wanted in my work around Scotland I'm encouraging churches to welcome and to value people with learning disabilities to make churches inclusive places where each person is seen for what they can do and not defined by their disability from Lerwick in Shetland to Peebles on the Scottish borders the Prospex song God loves you just the way you are is often sung as we sing it to each other we are reminded that God is pleased with his workmanship the second part of the verse from Ephesians reminds us that God planned good things for us to do things that only we can do so we need to step into our God-given plan and purpose be ourselves and not try to be someone else do the things that God wants us to do and encourage and support others as they fulfil their role as only they can at the Battle Battle of Banockburn Exhibition there's a poem inscribed on the Rotunda Monument and it contains the words small folk playing our part as each leaf is unique so are you can we be people who blend together beautifully to make a spectacular display to the glory of God
