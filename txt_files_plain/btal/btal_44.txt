first of all 
I would like to thank 
the members of your committee 
for inviting me 
to give a talk 
about the North Uist 
War 
Memorial 
it was unveiled 
on the twenty ninth of August 
nineteen 
twenty three 
on that day 
people from 
all over North Uist 
and surrounding islands 
are converging 
on a little 
heather-clad norn 
on which stands 
the memorial 
to the men of North Uist 
who gave their lives for king and country 
during the Great War 
a Union Jack 
drapes 
the memorial 
it was to be unveiled 
by a Colonel Cameron of Lochiel 
who has made the long journey 
from his home 
in Achnacarry 
on the mainland 
the little hill 
on which the memorial stands at Clachan North Uist 
is less than a hundred yards above sea level 
but from it 
on a clear day 
one can see the surrounding 
islands 
towards mid- 
day 
on the twenty ninth 
of August 
nineteen twenty three 
a crowd gathers 
round the memorial 
the majority of them 
have come 
from long distances 
old men 
and women 
and also many of the young 
and also our 
a lot of 
ex-servicemen 
wearing 
their war medals 
the hour of the unveiling arrives 
and the pipers take up their position 
beside the memorial 
Lochiel 
their chief of the Camerons 
arrives 
and he 's greeted 
by Sir Arthur 
Campbell-Orde 
the laird of North Uist 
a short service 
in which the local clergy take part 
begins 
with praise 
prayer 
and scripture reading 
then 
Sir Arthur 
Campbell-Orde 
who was chairman 
of the organising committee 
introduces Colonel Cameron of Lochiel 
as he speaks 
to the assembled audience 
he tells them 
that three emotions 
should be present 
in their minds 
that day 
the first 
sorrow 
because of the loss 
of so many 
valuable lives 
secondly 
pride 
that their men should have met so noble an end 
thirdly 
resolution 
that their 
great example 
should be present always 
in the minds 
of all 
the names 
of the fallen 
which were around a hundred and fifty 
are then 
read out 
and the pipers 
of the Scouts 
and Camerons 
play 
the lament 
the Flowers of the Forest 
and later on 
the Last 
Post 
then the crowds 
drift away 
from the impressive ceremony 
after 
some had pressed simple reeds 
on the memorial 
the memorial itself 
is made of the granite 
of the hillside 
and on top of it 
is a Celtic 
cross 
I understand 
the memorial was built 
by 
two 
uncles 
of the late 
Allan MacLean 
Locheport 
at the base of the memorial 
these words are written 
in English 
they died 
that we might live 
may we be worthy 
of their sacrifice 
and in Gaelic 
the words 
are written 
Mairidh 
A N'aimn 
Cu Suthain Sior 
a day 
long to be remembered 
by all 
present
