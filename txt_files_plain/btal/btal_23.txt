dear Presiding Officer 
erm 
I 'm grateful to Parliament for the opportunity to make a statement on our winter resilience in Scotland 
erm 
whilst we know that severe weather will cause disruption 
erm 
this government is taking a wide range of steps to improve 
our resilience to the challenges of winter 
erm to mitigate its impacts 
and also to recover our transport networks 
and businesses 
and allow daily life to get back to normal as quickly as possible 
today 's multiagency preparations for the amber weather warnings issued this morning I think are a good example of that 
our resilience work is undertaken in partnership with a broad range of public private and third sector partners 
and that 's included new investment 
development and innovation 
erm all of which have learned lessons from previous winters 
we have made sure that the lessons of previous winters were identified considered and acted upon through the work of the winter weather review group in two thousand and eleven 
erm and our ongoing lessons learned process 
it also tested and reflected on those lessons collectively 
with a wide range of partners through 
exercise polar storm in twenty eleven 
and exercise arctic blast 
and exercise green delta 
in twenty twelve 
plus a range of other exercises taking place locally 
and regionally 
erm launched erm 
they be launched and are running 
erm Scotland 's fourth national resilience week in a longer running preparedness campaign 
ready for winter 
erm winter in partnership with the British Red Cross 
and a wide range of other partners calling on everyone to make their own preparations 
for winter 
erm Transport Scotland 's r- winter service media launch was held earlier this week 
to promote and publicise the fact this winter 
their roads will be serviced more quickly 
than ever 
when snow and ice hit 
and we 're constantly working with our partners to improve the technology available and to protect events 
and also to provide early warning both to responders and to the public 
we 've supported the Met Office in developing major improvements to their national severe weather warning service 
and invested over eight million pounds in the floodline warnings direct scheme 
improving information to the public 
as to when they may be at risk from flooding 
and on the fourteenth of August twenty fourteen my colleague Paul Wheelhouse Minister for Environment and Climate Change 
announced Scotland 's first national centre for rel- 
resilience the NCR 
which will build on experience developed in the southwest of Scotland 
to develop national capabilities focussing on natural hazards 
community resilience 
flooding resilience 
as well as providing 
research 
purpose and 
facilities 
through the creation of the new centre for research on resilience 
we 've also invested sensibly in our transport resilience for example 
as of the fourth of November 
there were approximately six hundred and ninety three thousand tons of salt 
in stock 
erm on 
erm either in stock or on order 
and that includes the strategic salt reserve which the government has 
and that represents more than double the amount of salt that was used last winter 
we also have in place a range of new resources 
to improve intelligence to monitor patrol 
and where necessary 
to act 
erm the winter fleet for trunk roads 
will have an excess of one hundred and ninety five vehicles available for spreading salt 
and ploughing 
which is the highest level ever available on our trunk roads 
all of that fleet will be available to provide support to the front line and patrol vehicles 
as well as to cover breakdowns and essential maintenance 
during the twenty thirteen fourteen winter season seventy five new 
state-of-the-art gritters replaced older vehicles 
and thirty four of these new machines were bigger than the vehicle they replaced 
erm with a capacity to spread more salt 
erm the new fourth generation contracts winter service 
erm in the east commenced on the first of October this year 
and that will follow similar principles and by the end of twenty fourteen fifteen 
winter season 
new state-of-the-art gritters will be operational across the entire country 
erm new weather stations temperature sensors cameras 
messaging signs 
new icebreakers 
erm a stockpile of alternative de-icers 
and welfare kits to help anybody affected by disruption 
have all been introduced since two thousand and ten 
and the twenty fourteen Commonwealth Games legacy has also equipped 
Transport Scotland with a larger pool of staff trained in resilience operations 
while key parts of the network have been strengthened with increased camera infrastructure 
and we 'll build on that legacy 
to continually improve our response to severe events 
and significant investment is also taking place in our railways and in our airports 
erm ScotRail and NetworkRail have invested over four million pounds to improve winter resilience 
the airports have procured 
new equipment at their expense 
and 
developed specialist snow teams 
we 've also introduced new procedures to ensure resources are well used and the response to challenges 
is as effective as possible 
and that 's based on the successful operation of the multi-agency response team or MART 
erm the new purpose-built traffic Scotland control centre at South Queensferry 
will improve coordination and joint working 
all motorways continue to be covered by winter patrols which give a thirty minute response 
to incidence 
erm control rooms can monitor the temperature on key routes 
remotely through sensors and see the conditions live 
via a network of cameras 
and road users themselves can keep up to date through a range of media 
including internet 
internet radio 
erm 
smartphone updates on the move 
in addition to more traditional methods 
we 've also though worked with power and telecommunications companies to help them build their own response capability further 
through improved customer service arrangements 
the enhancement of key infrastructure 
and back-up systems 
and also increase customer information on being prepared 
it 's not just of course cold weather but erm extremely high winds can also lead to disruption 
erm but providers here are also taking additional steps based on the lessons of previous years 
and the government 's invested in back-up systems to ensure responders can continue to operate effectively 
we 're also supporting people to keep warm in their homes in spite of increases to energy bills 
unlike the UK government which has scrapped 
fuel poverty funding 
we 're committing almost a quarter of a billion pounds to it in a three-year period 
and we remain determined to help s- householders stay warm 
and reduce their energy bills 
and we 're working with councils and energy companies to tackle fuel poverty 
we 've also developed a protocol to help ensure that vulnerable people can be identified and prioritised should there be issues with supplies of 
electricity gas or heating oil 
we 're also continuing with our programme of work to build personal and community resilience 
investing in the future through the development 
of a resilience education resource 
erm Ready For Emergencies 
and that 's already been used by schools across Scotland to help young people assess risks 
and prepare themselves and their communities more effectively 
we also continue to support local communities that are taking steps to build their own 
erm community resilience 
through the uptake of our community emergency planning toolkit 
and through the provision of a range of financial and practical support to communities 
and also to local authorities 
we 've improved the operation of the government 's own emergency arrangements by reviewing the experience both 
of recent winters and also other major events for example we had the 
the erm volcanic ash cloud which erm 
which also caused substantial disruption 
erm and we 've required those arrangements to be used 
erm there 's continued development of the staffing and training arrangements for SGoRR 
erm and a new approach for sharing information between resilience partnerships and SGoRR when it 's active 
I think Presiding Officer it 's true to say that we try to learn something new each time Scotland is beset by severe weather 
we also try to make sure that we do n't just look at previous incidents and plan on that basis we 
try to plan for the unexpected 
it 's become a cliche now but I think we always try to prepare for the worst whilst hoping for the best 
not least in relation to the weather 
but it 's my view that the government and the responder community are doing all that they can to build Scotland 's resilience to severe weather for winter 
erm and all year round 
and at a time of severe economic challenges and environmental change 
we need to show that Scotland 's infrastructure 
and the services are ready to support our business and our people 
to be the resilient Scotland that we all want to see 
thank you very much
