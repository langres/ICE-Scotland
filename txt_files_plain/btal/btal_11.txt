thank you Presiding Officer for the invitation to address the parliament today 
as many of you know one of the main aims of the Poverty Alliance is to 
raise awareness and improve public understanding 
about poverty and inequality in Scotland 
in doing this 
we 're often a- 
called on to give talks and presentations about the issues 
over the years we 've spoken to thousands of people across Scotland 
from school pupils to trade unionists 
frontline workers and campaigners 
and of course politicians 
we 're asked to talk about the impact on individuals and communities 
or to highlight the root causes of what poverty is 
and of course we 're always asked 
to identify the solutions 
in these talks we often focus on the trends and the statistics 
you 'll be familiar with many of these the 
two hundred thousand children in Scotland who live in low income households 
the almost one million 
homes affected by fuel poverty 
or the four hundred thousand workers paid less than a living wage 
but we know what makes an impact 
is when we talk about the real lives behind those numbers 
the people 
not the statistics 
people like the young woman I know in Fife 
she 's a lone parent 
sometimes struggling to feed her family 
or to heat her home 
but she 's at College now 
and in the long term 
she will get her degree 
and she will continue to make a contribution to our community 
or the man 
from Glasgow that we work with 
whose life has been scarred by drugs and by crime 
who is a- 
who 's now clean 
and in recovery 
and he now spends much of his time volunteering 
and helping others 
make the journey he has made 
there are hundreds 
thousands of lives like these in Scotland 
ones that confound the expectations we have of poverty 
lives that highlight that 
real change is possible for individuals 
and that people are more than just passive victims 
but these stories also remind us that labels such as skiver scrounger 
or cheat 
just do n't fit 
then when it comes to what we do about poverty 
we have choices to make 
as our elected representatives 
you have more say over those choices than most 
you rightly debate about how we use our resources and focus our energies 
but in those debates 
never forget the people behind the statistics 
for in treating people 
living in poverty with dignity 
not as merely numbers or problems 
as we would expect to be treated 
I believe that we increase the chances of finding the lasting solutions 
to poverty 
that I know we all seek 
thank you very much
