Presiding Officer 
members of the Scottish Parliament 
thank you for your time and in-vitation 
to address you today 
at this time of year 
many of my fellow students 
face important exams 
determining their future 
however 
through my experiences at Strathclyde University 's Catholic Chaplaincy 
I have found not only 
that 
today 's you- young people rely on books 
and endless hours of studying 
in order to pass their exams 
but increasingly 
they also look for spiritual support 
through my involvement at the Chaplaincy and other youth groups 
I have witnessed a great deal of young people 
embrace their faith despite social pressures 
this faith journey 
is one that does require a great deal of courage 
since at times religious faith is portrayed as something negative 
but this is a journey 
which brings so much joy 
and meaning to people 's lives 
a recent message from Pope Francis 
resonated with my experience 
using twitter 
he said 
it is not easy to follow Jesus closely 
because the path he chooses 
is the way of the cross 
so often we find that in some way or an- other 
or another 
everyone has a cross to bear 
be it poverty 
loneliness 
or illness 
and central to the Christian message 
is that we should have a willingness to help people with their cross 
for many of us we bear a cross 
for the sake of serving those around us 
and being as Christ to them 
so much of the work of political life 
is in fact taking the problems of others 
on your own shoulders 
that spirit of service for the common good 
is the heart of the Christian message 
it means loving God 
and treating others as we wish 
to be treated ourselves 
I am therefore convinced 
that Scotland still has much to benefit from the Christian faith 
my hope for the future 
is that more people do find the courage 
to embrace and express their faith 
and I hope that you 
as members of our Scottish Parliament 
to co- 
continue to show courage 
in the decisions that you make to legislate for the people of Scotland 
be assured that you are in the prayers of Christians nationwide 
finally 
I would like to end with the words of Saint John Paul the Second 
true holiness does not mean a flight from the world 
rather 
it lies in the effort to incarnate the Gospel 
in everyday life 
in the family 
at school and at work 
and in social and political involvement 
thank you
