Presiding Officer this 
debate follows a theme of members ' debates that 
and issues that I 've brought before 
to this parliament and that 's the cle- 
theme 
of class justice or more accurately 
injustice 
and I want to thank members from across the parliament for supporting the motion and allowing 
the debate to take place the 
issue raised today 
I think gets to the heart of the principles of our criminal justice system 
and asks a key question 
do we have a policing system 
in this country and a justice system that treats everyone the same 
irrespective of your class your status your colour religion 
your 
or your political 
persuasion 
or do we have one that picks out individuals 
and groups for special treatment 
because they challenge 
the prevailing orthodoxy the e- 
established order 
or threaten 
even in a tiny way 
the grip 
that those in positions 
of power 
have on our economy 
and our society 
if we look over 
my very 
young lifetime 
we can see 
numerous instances 
where vested interest in the media 
and big business 
government the police and the courts 
have worked together to quash dissent 
control people 's behaviour 
and prevent any challenge 
to their grip 
on power this has been done through anti-trade union legislation 
court reform 
anti-terror red- legislation 
and much 
much more and if you look at cases like those 
of the Shrewsbury twenty four 
the Cammell Laird thirty seven 
the ninety six Hillsborough fans 
the ordinary victims 
of phone hacking not the celebrities 
the family of Stephen Lawrence 
the ninety five miners arrested at Orgreave the three hundred 
Scottish miners arrested at Ravenscraig 
the four thousand 
blacklisted construction workers four hundred of them 
Scottish 
we can see the state machine conspiring with powerful interests 
against ordinary working people 
whose only crime was to defend their jobs 
their communities 
support their fellow workers 
or even support 
their football team 
I suspect that in all of these cases 
and many more 
undercover police officers have been operating 
with the freedom 
to do whatever they want 
with little control 
little accountability 
or 
outwith any ethical framewa- 
-work 
in which they should be carrying out their activities 
and all of this apparently sanctioned 
by senior officers 
in 
the area in which they were operating 
and that includes Scotland 
and my interest in this stems from my 
work on blacklisting we know 
that the security forces 
have been involved 
in political indust- and industrial campaigns 
going back to the suffragettes and beyond 
but in this case what we had 
was Special Branch 
working hand in glove 
with the Consulting Association not to prevent terrorism 
or 
erm erm or 
potential threats to life 
but to infiltrate 
legitimate democratic trade unions cul- 
and in collaboration 
with big construction companies 
to deny people the right to work 
we now know 
that at least a hundred and twenty undercover officers 
have been deployed by the special 
demonstration squad 
since its formation 
in nineteen sixty eight 
but only so 
so far only twelve 
have been exposed 
half of whom worked in Scotland 
the most infamous being Mark Kennedy 
deployed 
here fourteen times 
in his seven year career 
and we know now 
that he targeted Scottish workers 
they targeted 
environmental activists who campaigned 
at the G eight 
in Gleneagles 
one of whom 
now works 
for a SNP an SNP MP 
they targeted trade union officials 
they targeted at least ten Labour MPs 
including 
the now leader 
of the Labour Party 
they did not gather evidence for use in court 
they amassed intelligence so they could be m- 
people could be monitored 
anticipated 
and disrupted 
and these people acted 
as a law unto themselves 
an internal Met report from two thousand and nine said 
says they preferred the less bureaucratic approach 
and directed their operational 
activity 
without intrusive 
senior supervision 
and management 
the SDS directed their own operations 
with significant 
tactical 
latitude 
and minimal organisation 
organisational constraints 
that 's code for they did whatever they liked 
and 
their tactics were truly 
abhorrent 
the majority 
of known officers 
had long-lasting and intimate relationships with people 
they spied upon 
three officers 
engaged in relationships 
with women 
in Scotland 
this 
was all part of the strategy 
more than one 
had a child 
to a woman 
whilst pretending to be someone else 
one victim 
described it 
and I quote as being like raped 
by 
the state 
this 
is the police 
in our country operating like this 
it is 
outrageous 
officers acted 
as agents provocateurs encouraging activists 
into confrontations 
and taking key roles 
in the organisation of events 
Kennedy was the transport co-ordinator for the protests 
at the G eight 
whilst 
Jasob erm Jason Bishop Marco Jacobs 
both drove van loads of activists up from En- England 
another officer 
Lynn Watson 
was also 
at the G eight as part of the action 
medical team 
now often officers 
have since received convictions 
under their false identity 
withholding evidence during court cases 
erm evidence 
that undermined 
those very court cases 
in a other- any other circu- circumstances that would be perjury 
and perverting the course 
of justice 
we 've now found out that more than fifty convictions 
have been quashed since this scandal came to light 
and what kind of false 
identity 
did they take up 
well for some of them 
it was the identity 
of a 
dead 
child 
a dead 
child 
this 
is the police 
Presiding Officer 
police office- offic- of- officers operating in our country 
under the identity 
of a dead child to victimise 
people 
whose only crime 
is to want a fairer 
cleaner 
and more just society 
I do n't know about you but I find that nauseating 
and utterly corrupt 
in response to this being exposed 
the UK government has commissioned the Pitchford inquiry 
and can I commend Theresa May on doing so 
and that has a remit to inquire into and report on undercover police operations 
conducted by English and Welf- Welsh police forces in England and Wales 
since nineteen 
sixty eight 
Pitchford does not cover Scotland 
and when I asked the Cabinet Secretary last year if police were spying on trade union environmental and political activists 
in his party 
and mine 
he said and I quote 
I have no idea 
now this was both 
erm astonishing in both its arrogance and its complacency 
then 
on the day of the recess as we all 
went off for Christmas he slipped out a letter 
to the ten MSPs 
who had written to him stating 
that he now wants Pitchford 
extended to look at the operations that happened 
in Scotland 
Presiding Officer 
police officers commited a string of human rights abuses 
against Scottish citizens 
on Scottish soil 
we do n't know 
what arrangements 
they had with Scottish police forces 
we do n't know 
if this arrangement happened 
erm 
in other 
force areas 
erm 
nor do we know 
which 
campaigns they outfa- infiltrated 
we do n't know 
which 
erm Scots they spied upon 
we do n't know how many of our citizens 
were affected 
Presiding Officer if this 
was happening elsewhere 
there would be condemnation 
all round 
but it is 
or it has 
happened under our noses 
the i- 
the Cabinet Secretary 
has n't appeared for the debate I find that 
sad that he has n't 
on such an important issue 
but maybe the minister 
can confirm 
that if the 
Home Secretary refuses 
to extend the remit of Pitchford to Scotland 
then will the Cabinet Secretary 
instruct a similar 
judge-led inquiry 
here 
Presiding Officer I I 'm well over time 
there 's so much more I want to say on this matter 
but time does n't allow 
allow it 
but this is a scandal 
this is an affront to our democracy 
we have to expose 
what went on 
here 
in Scotland 
and we must ensure 
that nothing like this 
ever ever happens again
