as Minister of Canongate Kirk may I take the opportunity of this first 
Time for Reflection of the new session of the Scottish Parliament 
not only to congratulate you on your 
election 
but to welcome you 
to the parish 
Canongate is also the parish church for the palace of Holyroodhouse 
and of Edinburgh Castle 
and it 's with our role as Edinburgh 's military church in mind that I want to focus briefly 
and probably inevitably 
on the centenary 
of the Battle of Jutland 
which began exactly one hundred years ago today and ended 
one hundred years ago 
tomorrow 
the largest naval action of the First World War it remains something of a controversial battle 
in that both sides claimed victory 
of sorts 
the Royal Navy 's Grand Fleet under the command of admiral Sir John Jellicoe and based largely 
in Scottish waters 
lost over six thousand sailors and fourteen ships 
out of a total of sixty thousand sailors 
and a hundred and fifty one ships 
while the imperial 
German High Sea Fleet lost two thousand five hundred men 
and eleven ships out of a total of forty five thousand sailors 
and ninety nine ships the comparative losses 
meant 
that the Germans claimed victory 
but the blockade 
which they 'd been trying 
to break remained in place 
for the rest of the war 
and British domination of the North Sea 
remained secure 
as so often when the fog and 
confusion of battle had lifted 
questions were asked about some of the decisions taken by those in command on both sides 
but the bravery of certain individuals who lost their lives 
on the thirty first of May and on the first of June 
nineteen sixteen has always been beyond doubt 
men like Francis Harvey of the Royal Marine 's Light Infantry 
who prevented a magazine igniting and blowing up an entire ship 
boys 
like John Travers Cornwell 
the sixteen year-old who famously remained at his post 
while seriously injured 
but died in hospital 
before his mother 
could reach his bedside 
both of them 
were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross 
and it is their valour 
and the service and sacrifice of so many like them 
to which we should surely devote time for reflection 
today 
and tomorrow
