there is still much to discover about the seas of Scotland 
over a hundred miles to the northwest of the Outer Hebrides 
way out into the Atlantic and deep in the Rockall Trough 
lies a massive extinct volcano 
that rises one thousand nine hundred metres from the seabed 
that 's five hundred metres higher than Ben Nevis 
this single seamount 
known as the Rosemary Bank 
is a staggering thirty five miles across 
that 's comparable in size to the entire Cairngorms National Park 
this year the Scottish government 
designated Rosemary Bank 
as a marine protected area 
and this September 
scientists from Marine Scotland 
set out aboard the research vessel Scotia 
to survey the area 
with the aim 
of discovering 
and mapping out the species 
habitats 
and ecosystems 
of the Rosemary Bank 
at depths of between one thousand two hundred 
to one thousand five hundred metres 
we deployed a camera 
that flies over the seabed 
recording what lies beneath 
in high-definition video 
we had never surveyed to these depths before 
and it took nearly an hour for the camera to drop down 
through the water column 
until at last the seabed came into view 
as more lights were switched on 
and two laserpointers gave us a sense of scale 
we began to realise 
that what we were seeing 
was possibly the most extensive 
and pristine spongeries 
to have been reported 
from UK waters 
sponges 
are an evolutionary 
ancient group of filter-feeding animals 
that are found all the way from the coastline to the deep sea 
most deep sea species 
have a sceletal structure made of silica 
and are very different 
from the soft variety you might find in your bathtub 
as the footage shows 
they more resemble birdsnests mushrooms or large cheeses 
you would not want to wash yourself 
with these sponges 
they have the texture of loft insulation 
and a very peculiar smell 
they form dense aggregations 
and over decades to centuries these become diverse biogenic ecosystems that cycle nutrients 
filter enormous volumes of water 
and provide refuge 
for many other species of fish and invertebrates 
you can see 
at least two distinct types of sponges 
the large white 
vase-like 
or globular ones 
these are known as the Geodia sponges 
and the smaller 
hairy-looking ones 
and these are known 
as the glass sponges 
between the sponges we glimpsed many other species 
including deep sea sharks 
orange roughy 
grenadier fish 
eels squad lobsters 
and octopus 
we estimated the area of sponges to be anything between seventy five and two hundred and fifty kilometres squared 
perhaps even larger 
as we 're only able to explore a small fraction of the seamount 
there must be millions of sponges down there 
and when one considers that each kilogramme 
of sponge is estimated to filter a cubicmetre of water each day 
that 's a lot of ocean filtration going on down there 
at present we can only guess as to what role 
such an ecosystem plays 
in maintaining a healthy ocean 
sponge reefs 
such as those on Rosemary Bank 
are highly vulnerable to damage 
by bottom fisheries 
and other human disturbance 
and so require 
protection 
from these types of human activities 
the United Nations has recently passed 
resolutions for the protection of such ecosystems 
and it is important 
that we carefully manage any human activities in such areas 
fortunately 
this area 
appears to be mostly in pristine condition as far as we could make out 
and the designation of Rosemary Bank 
as a marine protected area 
will hopefully help ensure 
its potential value and biodiversity 
and ecosystem function 
is maintained 
for the future
