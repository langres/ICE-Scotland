I myself have been very very privileged 
to have been here since nineteen ninety nine and so I knew 
Donald Dewar 
so it 's a particular pleasure to be chairing this event 
for the first time in my new role as Deputy Presiding Officer 
I 've often heard it said 
that 
the Dewar Debate is a highlight 
in this parliament 's calendar 
having presided over proceedings in this chamber throughout this week I 'm really looking forward 
to hearing the arguments and ideas of our younger speakers this evening 
and it 's great 
to see our member seats filled 
with school pupils you are all very very welcome 
there were a hundred and twenty teams 
representing schools 
from around our country 
who set out on the road to Holyrood in November last year 
two hundred and fifty six pupils for 
one hundred and four schools entered 
and that 's more schools than took part 
in previous years 
this year there were thirty two 
first round heats sixteen second round heats 
and four semi-finals 
and these have been whittled down 
to the four very talented teams 
who will be competing 
in this evening 's grand final 
so congratulations 
to all the finalists 
who I will introduce shortly 
and to the other four schools who will also take up seats 
on the chamber floor 
they will have the opportunity to participate in the open floor debates during the course of the tournament 
the competition itself is 
organised by the Law Society of Scotland and 
thank you to everyone 
at the Society for all of their hard work and effort 
in this regard 
I 'd also like to thank the tournament sponsors 
Hodder Gibson publishers and the Glasgow Bar Association 
for their much-valued support 
Donald Dewar 
was Scotland 's first 
First Minister 
of this parliament 
and Donald died far too early 
and the tournament was set up 
and dedicated to Donald 's memory 
Donald Dewar was a student of History and Law and he practised as a solicitor 
in between periods of serving as a member of the House of Commons 
where he represented seats 
in Aberdeen 
and then Glasgow 
he was a member of the Glasgow Dialectic Society and was a 
frequent participant 
in its debates 
alongside his contemporaries many of whom 
moved into high-profile jobs in politics law 
and the media 
Donald retained his passion for debating 
right through his political career 
in the House of Commons and in the early days of this parliament 
in his first speech 
in what was then our new Scottish Parliament 
Donald said 
today 
there is a new voice in the land 
the voice of a democratic 
parliament 
a voice to shape Scotland 
a voice 
for the future 
so it is fitting 
that 
occupying the seats of our parliamentarians tonight 
are those 
who are potentially 
the future 
lawmakers 
the politicians 
and the lawyers 
it 's also fitting 
that this chamber continues 
to reverberate to the sound of our new generation 
of debaters 
through this annual competition 
and I certainly hope 
that this experience has a positive 
and lasting effect 
on your future 
finally 
joining us in the Public Gallery tonight 
are many many proud parents 
class mates 
clad- sorry class mates 
and teachers 
you are very very welcome and it 's wonderful to see all of you here 
I hope you enjoy your evening here 
at Holyrood 
so 
I wish all of the finalists 
the very best of luck 
it was n't luck that brought you here it was talent 
but I wish you luck 
tonight 
and I hope you all have a very enjoyable evening here 
in your 
parliament 
thank you very much
