your Excellencies Presiding Officer members of the Scottish Parliament Carnegie medalists Lords and Ladies Carnegie Trustees honoured guests on behalf of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust  and the three other Carnegie Trusts operating from Dunfermline Andrew Carnegie's hometown we are delighted that this Medal Ceremony has returned to the Scottish Parliament in the year twenty thirteen the centenary of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust one hundred years ago Andrew Carnegie made the decision to establish a foundation for the benefit of the people throughout the United Kingdom in planning our centenary year we were aba- adamant that this was not just to be a birthday celebration the Trustees wanted to use the past as a gravitational slingshot into the future by understanding and strengthening our history we wanted to build on connections and partnerships we've used in the past to increase our impact over the coming years many in the audience today are representing organisations we have supported funded and worked with in those one hundred years and we hope to work with them again over the next one hundred years many of you are new stakeholders and we look to many years of partnership and joint working we have written a short accessible history of the Trust highlighting our successes and failures and yes we have failed on occasion and we've learned from those failures we've digitised all our archives and minutes and placed the first fifty years of it our minutes online as well as one hundred years of reports these minutes make some very interesting reading with the Trustees all these years ago having just as robust and challenging discussions as they do today we now twitter news create infographics of our reports and produce film rather than press releases and publications in short the world is at a very different place from what it was one hundred years ago so it's my privilege and honour to introduce a documentary film on how our society has changed over these one hundred years now you don't n- need to be concerned about the length of this film we've managed to encapsulate one hundred years into a very small number of minutes so do not worry on that score thank you and I hope you enjoy the film
