Presiding Officer members of the Scottish parliament today you may be surprised to discover that I'm not here to talk business or education but about how I had been personally inspired by an incredible paper book sculpture called the Butterflies which is currently outside of this chamber this talk is about what this sculpture means to me those who have seen it and what it can represent for Scotland made by an anonymous artist who has left amazing paper sculptures in Edinburgh libraries and museums each of these intricately and carefully crafted pieces comes with a label promoting libraries and public spaces this artist has become the subject of a book a tourist trail and is an internet phenomenon imagine a tattoo book open on end with the butterflies flying out this is the Butterfly sculpture originally made to raise funds for a cancer charity it has been touring Scotland in a not-for-profit basis this sculpture's tour began a year ago in the war poets library in Edinburgh University Napier University's Craiglockhart campus where I began my personal academic journey as an adult it has also been in the UK Library of the Year in Kirkwall in Dumfries and Galloway Aberdeen East Lothian in the ? Village Library in Abbotsford and most recently in a place where I grew up South Nitshill Glasgow South Nitshill used to be a place of violence and hopelessness and what I would call in the words of Billy Connolly a desert wi' windaes that has now changed I could not imagine that I would be returning as an adult with a piece of art in the hope of inspiring children adults and teenagers for me the Butterfly sculpture represents freedom a flight from poverty and freedom from violence the Butterfly sculpture like most art projects multiple perceptions many people are inspired because they see an individual who has spent hundreds if not thousands of hours without desire of public recognition to promote a worthwhile cause this piece can be said to represent the many unsung heroes in our society these actions represent what is good about people this art has been warmly and enthusiastically received wherever it has appeared however it's not the object that's special it's made from paper and a recycled book and not meant to last it's what it represents that is important it's a story a cause a mystery a journey designed to inspire my message to the Scottish parliament today is let us inspire social causes let us inspire business together let us create a country with a focus on inspiration thank you
