good afternoon everyone 
thank you for allowing me to come 
as it 's Lent 
I 
was reflecting on giving 
and I would like to share with you some examples of giving 
in recent 
and not so recent history 
the latter of course 
is Jesus Christ 
who lay down his life for all 
for those who do not believe and for those who believe 
other examples of exemplary giving 
are 
Father Maximilian Kolbe who was a Franciscan priest 
and gave up his life in Auschwitz 
to save the life of a young married father 
Dietrich Bonhoeffer 
a Lutheran pastor 
who was a fierce opponent of Hitler and the Nazi party 
was killed because of his outspoken Christian beliefs 
Mother Teresa of Calcutta 
loved and served the poor in India 
and she wrote 
I have found a paradox 
that if you love 
and give until it hurts 
there can be no more hurt 
only love 
last but not least 
professor William Barclay 
Church of Scotland theologian 
gave his life to the service of Christianity 
in his prolific and beautiful witness and writings 
all of these people 
were in my young days 
an inspiration of love and giving 
not all of us are called to such exemplary giving 
but we do share an ability to give something 
all of us are called to it 
and to loving our fellow human beings 
even if it is in small ways 
a commitment to a hundred small daily givings in every country around the world 
could become a tsunami of love and giving 
if only we could truly believe 
in the power of human goodness 
and its ability to change the world 
I read a quote 
from Marvin Olasky who said 
giving generously 
and giving forgiveness 
are at the root of knowing God 
and I would add knowing ourselves 
so what can we do 
to name but a few things 
giving good example 
giving ourselves to our country 
to others 
our time 
our forgiveness 
our love and encouragement 
our acceptance 
our honesty 
and our non-biased support 
and judgments 
I would like to quote from Albert Schweitzer also 
and he said 
I can not accept life and its happiness 
as a matter of course 
I must give something in exchange for it 
each of us must decide 
what is it that we can consistently give 
giving to all as and when we can 
we will be part then 
will we be part then of a tsunami of giving 
I pray and hope that we are 
and I would like to thank you for your giving 
your time to me 
and I ask God to bless each and everyone of you 
thank you
