thank you Deputy Presiding Officer ladies and gentlemen judges and competitors I'm delighted to be once again standing here at the final of the Donald Dewar memorial debating tournament twenty fourteen is a hugely important year for Scotland along with Glasgow hosting the Commonwealth Games this summer this is also the year in which Scotland will have its say over independence in particular many of the individuals sitting on the floor tonight will for the first time be able to vote and take part in this important debate and important decision having heard the very thoughtful and well-researched arguments tonight from our teams and also from the con- contributions from the floor I know Scotland's future will be in very safe hands if this is an example of the capabilities of our young citizens regardless of the outcome of the referendum in extending thanks can I start by saying thank you to those who have made the tournament a success this year but before I do that I think I'd like to remind you just what's been involved in this tournament and why the competitors all of them have done so well in reaching this final for some of our judges coaches teachers and perhaps even competitors it might seem like no time at all since we were last year in the Scottish parliament for the twenty thirteen final however between then and now there's been a year of competition to reach the final of this tournament all teams have to compete in the first round with three other teams which takes place in November the best two teams from the that heat then progress to the second round which takes place in January again there are four teams in each of the second round heat but this time only one team progresses in the semi-finals all the teams must debate a short prep motion this means they're given the motion one hour before their task with debating it in front of the judges they're given no access to books and no access to computers during the time so it really is a test of their debating skills and their ability to think on their feet the winners the winners of each of the semi-finals are the four teams who you have seen debating in front of you this evening I'm sure you all agree that they have provided us with a fabulous evening of debate and most definitely all deserve the place in this final can I now turn to our winners Craigmount High who will just have a few more minutes to wait before they can receive their prizes the Donald Dewar memorial is the largest debating tournament in Scotland and schools from across schoo- Scotland take part each year to get to the final four is a significant achievement in itself and well done to our winners for going one step further to be crowned champions this year I hope you will all remember this evening for a very long time to come and you should all feel very proud can I also congratulate all of our finalists your debates made for an entertaining an exciting evening and I hope you decide to continue to debate throughout school and beyond one of the main reasons the teams are so thrilled to get t- to the final is to have this very rare opportunity to bate to debate in this prestigious venue I'd like to thank the Deputy Presiding Officer John Scott MSP and of course all the staff at the parliament including the education team and event managers Vicky Little and Lindsey Davey in particular for allowing us to host the final here and for making tonight such a success your continued support of this tournament is hugely appreciated I would also like to thank all the participants from the floor debate the floor debates get livelier and more eng- engaging each year and this evening was certainly no exception well done to all the contributors and in particular to Emily from Du- Dunblane our floor prize winner tonight I was actually a bit worried earlier on that you couldn't see her over my head so thanks erm that didn't stop her making her contribution some of you might be debators already or some of you this might be just giving you a taste for debate so we hope to see many of you enter the twenty fifteen tournament when it starts again in the autumn standing up here to address you gives me a great picture of just how many people are sitting up in the gallery supporting our debators this evening I know there are friends there are family members there are coaches and there are teachers who will have been very proud to see their teams competing tonight can I thank you all for supporting this tournament and in particular can I thank the debate

year of of hard work we really do appreciate the time you take to attend the heats to provide constructive and helpful feedback often travelling great distances to schools and often in the winter through difficult weather we hope you've enjoyed being involved and you're all ready to planning to be a judge again can I particularly thank our panel of judges tonight sitting in front here every year during a debate I am grateful that I am not part of that group and having to decide between the teams it is really a tough task and tonight was a particular example of that I hope you have
