Presiding Officer 
members of the Scottish parliament 
thank you for the opportunity to address you today 
for all of us 
there will be times when the threat of dying 
intrudes on our lives 
and expectations 
it might be when the doctor diagnoses you with cancer 
it might be when your mother 
starts to show the signs of dementia 
or it might be 
when your child is born with a life-shortening condition 
this 
is Children 's Hospice Week 
and the theme is 
take a moment 
CHAS 
is Scotland 's only children 's hospice service 
providing 
vital love care and support 
for babies children and young people 
with life-shortening conditions 
across Scotland 
our vision 
is that every 
baby child 
and young person 
will have access to palliative care 
when and where they need it 
CHAS 
puts the child who needs care and support 
at the heart of everything we do 
we provide opportunities for fun 
play 
and enjoyment 
alongside palliative and end-of-life care 
understanding their importance 
even against a background of serious illness 
and the likelihood 
of early death 
we support a child 
and their family 's choice of 
life-enriching opportunities and shared experiences 
helping the child 
and his or her siblings 
to live life to the full 
creating treasured memories 
we work with families 
and other health and social care professionals to develop aniticicat- anticipatory care plans 
that capture the family 's wishes 
hopes 
and dreams 
at an early stage 
and on a regular basis 
we do all of this 
in a way that is rights-based 
and ensures the care we offer 
is safe 
effective 
person-centred 
and promotes wellbeing 
in line with getting it right for every child 
and the articles contained within the United Nations Convention 
on the rights for the child 
our aim 
is to help families 
stay connected to their natural 
and local support networks 
and help them 
to maintain and develop 
positive coping strategies as a family 
however 
coping 
with the death of your child 
is possibly the hardest thing 
a parent will ever have to do 
CHAS 
helps families find a way through the grief 
and stays beside them while they make their difficult journey 
every 
step of the way 
a mum said to me recently 
just the three of us sitting on the couch 
with no noises 
or wires stuck all over her little body 
just one tube in her nose 
Julianne felt like ours for the very first time 
it was like being home 
please take a moment 
to think of these families
