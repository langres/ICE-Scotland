Presiding Officer thank you very much for inviting me to speak today now members of the Scottish parliament I hope you would agree erm that the aims of politics and philosophy are the same to increase happiness and well-being now happiness is a nebulous concept erm but there are those who believe they can measure it and when the UN compiled its latest World Happiness Report Scotland as part of the UK didn't even make it into the top twenty which rather begs the question would Scotland be happier in a different political landscape well you may say so I couldn't possibly comment now one Scottish city however is punching well above its weight in the happiness stakes two years ago a survey found that Edinburgh was the happiest city in the UK and only two months ago Conde Nast Traveler said it was one of the friendliest cities in the world something has clearly changed for generations we were led to believe that life was a veil of tears and earthly happiness a snare and a delusion happiness might be a reward in the next life but only if you toe the line in this now that began to change in seventeen seventy six when Thomas Jefferson inspired by the writings of the Enlightenment philosophers Francis Hutcheson and David Hume enshrined the pursuit of happiness in the American Declaration of Independence since then we've come rather to regard happiness as a universal human right but and it pains me to say this we Scots weren't the first to conceive this radical idea because almost forty years earlier halfway across the world in the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan the legal code decreed if the government cannot create happiness for its people there is no purpose for the government to exist Bhutan remains one of the poorest states in the world but for forty years now it's inspired governments everywhere to look beyond GDP as a measure of a nation's health because Bhutan in nineteen seventy seven I think was the first country to measure Gross National Happiness and now we're all doing it erm just last week the Office for National Statistics revealed that the happiest place in the UK is Fermanagh erm while Londoners remain amongst the most miserable people in the country but the paradox of happiness is that we only find it when we're searching for something else and I think the nineteenth century humanist philosopher Robert Ingersoll put it best as he said happiness is the only good and the way to be happy is to make others so members of the Scottish parliament may you find happiness by making the people of Scotland happy thank you for listening
