well good morning conference 
and the countdown 
has started 
in just a few weeks international leaders will meet in Paris 
to agree a new legally binding 
climate change agreement 
and it 's fair to say 
that our future 
and that of generations to come 
depends on a successful outcome 
now I 'm delighted 
to move this motion 
and to open the debate this morning not least because 
it allows me 
to update you on the work that this SNP Scottish government is doing towards meeting 
our world leading climate change targets 
and to show the way 
internationally 
during the run-up to Paris 
I 've been promoting Scotland 's actions 
on climate change 
to the international community 
and the global community 
must match Scotland 's high ambition 
if the new global climate treaty to be agreed 
at Paris in December 
is to stand a good chance of limiting 
global temperature rise 
to no more 
than two degrees 
centigrade 
now in two thousand and nine conference 
the Scottish parliament acted unilaterally 
to set high ambition 
both pre- and post-twenty twenty 
in line 
with the climate science 
so there is support 
for our ambitious targets across all sectors 
of Scottish society 
including 
cross-party support 
in our own parliament 
and Scotland Conference 
is already 
three quarters of the way 
to its world leading twenty twenty target 
of a forty two percent emissions cut 
by 
by twenty twenty 
with a thirty eight point four percent cut 
in two thousand and thirteen 
compared to nineteen ninety 
let me repeat that conference 
we are three quarters 
of the way there 
with five years 
still to go 
so we are making 
significant 
progress 
now in the past year 
Scotland has signed the Under two MOU 
committing devolved governments 
to reduce emissions by at least 
eighty percent 
by twenty fifty 
and we 've also signed 
what 's called the Compact 
of States and Regions 
which reports to the UN 
on progress towards targets 
by an economic grouping 
that represents two hundred 
and twenty million people 
and ten percent of our global GDP 
our legislation 
was designed to provide 
certainty 
for businesses 
and the people of Scotland 
about Scotland 's 
low-carbon future 
and that low-carbon transition 
is a key priority 
in our government 's 
economic strategy 
and the evidence from Scotland 
shows to the rest of the world 
that the low-carbon transition 
does deliver 
jobs 
investment 
trade 
and economic growth 
and we have a strategy 
of staying at the forefront 
of innovation 
on low-carbon technology 
regulationed 
and financed 
now despite everything 
you know Scotland already now generates almost half of its electricity needs 
from renewables 
we 've developed 
strong case studies in areas such as the Scottish whiskey industry 
and Glasgow 's LED Street Lighting projects supported by the Green Investment Bank 
our sustainable major events like the Commonwealth Games 
and a Rider Cup 
as well as Aberdeen 's very own fleet 
of hydrogen 
buses 
and of course in June 
we announced designating 
the energy efficiency 
of Scotland 's buildings 
and national infrastructure 
priority 
Conference 
we are also putting 
human rights 
right at the heart of climate change policy 
championing 
climate justice 
at home and abroad 
as set out in the Scottish National Action Plan and human rights 
and our innovative 
six million pounds climate justice fund 
is supporting eleven 
water adaptation projects 
in Malawi 
Tanzania 
Rwanda 
and Malawi 
so Conference 
Scotland has an absolutely 
fantastic story to tell 
on climate change ambition 
and delivery 
and we hope 
the Paris climate summit 
will be a big step forward 
for the international fight against climate change 
now the new pledges that have been made by countries for the Paris conference for the period 
up to twenty thirty 
now cover 
around ninety percent of global emissions 
and they could bring that temperature rise down to around 
three degree Celsius 
that is a good start of course 
but we will need to go further 
so it 's absolutely crucial 
that we follow up on the Paris conference 
with a further push 
to limit global warming 
to two degree Celsius or less 
and so that we avoid 
the worst impacts 
of climate change 
falling 
on the world 's poorest and most vulnerable 
people 
the conference I am absolutely 
committed to using 
all of our levers and resources 
to achieving 
a positive outcome 
in Paris 
because the international community 
will have to match Scotland 's commitment 
if the Paris Climate Summit 
is to form the foundation for a truly effective global response 
on climate change 
in the years ahead 
and to finish 
conference 
I am delighted to confirm 
that representing the Scottish government 
I will be joining 
the UK delegation 
at the UNF triple C Conference of Parties in Paris 
and making sure 
that our action 
and high ambition 
provides a beacon 
for our international partners 
conference 
let 's send 
a very clear 
and ambitious message from this auditorium 
to the international community to follow 
Scotland 's example 
and strive 
for the highest 
global ambition 
to tackle climate change 
and ensure 
an ambitious 
legally binding climate change agreement 
in Paris 
in December 
and I 'd ask you to please support this motion
