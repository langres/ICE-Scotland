Presiding Officer 
the 
NHS failed the thirty four patients who died at the Vale of Leven hospital 
it failed the patients who suffered 
due to the outbreak of C difficile 
and it failed 
the families of those patients too 
our NHS failed all of these patients and their families and for me 
I 'm sure everyone here today 
that is deeply regrettable 
and I 'm 
sorry 
on behalf of the Scottish government 
Lord MacLean highlights thirty four deaths 
an increase on previous findings and this follows his detailed scrutiny 
of medical records 
and that was important 
erm 
an important purpose of the inquiry to establish 
the facts 
on behalf of the Scottish government and their NHS I want to offer a profound and sincere apology 
to all those patients and families affected by this tragedy 
our thoughts must be with all of them today 
and I 'm aware that some of them have joined us today in the chamber this afternoon 
this statement is the Scottish government 's initial response to the Vale of Leven hospital inquiry report published 
by Lord MacLean yesterday 
the report was laid in parliament yesterday in line with the requirements of the inquiry 's act two thousand and five 
I believe the report addresses the wide-ranging terms of reference set by the chairman 
who was charged with undertaking a thorough investigation 
into the circumstances contributing to the occurrence and rates of C difficile infection 
at the Vale of Le- 
Le- 
Vale of Leven hospital 
from the first of January two thousand and seven 
to the first of June two thousand and eight 
I 'd like to take this opportunity to thank Lord MacLean and his team for their hard work and commitment to the inquiry 
I 'd also like to put on 
record my personal thanks to the patients and families for their frank 
and honest evidence 
to the inquiry 
the patients and families of those who were affected by the outbreak quite rightly demanded this public inquiry to investigate what happened 
why it happened 
and ensure lessons are learned 
it 's clear from my meeting with them that these issues are still driving their search for answers 
I believe the report is both balanced and fair 
and I hope it 'll go some way 
to addressing those answers the patients and families are seeking 
since the 
inquiry was established there have been 
some criticism 
of the cost and length of time that it 's taken 
to report its findings 
under the inquiries act two thousand and five and the rules it 's clear 
that this is a matter for the chairman of the inquiry to determine the procedure and conduct required in order to carry out its duties effectively 
I believe the chairman has 
published costs of the inquiry up to the twenty fourth of November 
at his launch yesterday 
and the final costs will be provided later this year 
although Lord MacLean did acknowledge in his report the ministers wanted a shorter inquiry it 's clear 
that the length of delay had a profound effect on patients and families 
and did nothing to alleviate their distress 
I hope that the publication of this report will begin to bring closure 
for those families and patients 
and to the patients and families 
for those of you who have read the report 
it makes terrible reading 
and identifies system-wide and individual failures at the Vale of Leven hospital 
the report is a thorough 
and definitive explanation 
of what went wrong 
and it 's clear there was failure at all levels 
from nursing 
medicine 
through 
to management 
Lord MacLean 's 
findings outline the lack of investment in the hospital which 
was simply no longer fit for purpose 
there was a lack of basic care provided to patients 
no inspection regime was in place 
communication was poor at all levels 
morale of staff 
was low 
much of this was related to the uncertainty of the merger of Clyde 
into NHS 
NHS Greater Glasgow 
which was announced in two thousand and five 
this was n't implemented until after the outbreak 
and resulted in a fundamental breakdown in lines of reporting 
as I said to the patients and families I met yesterday 
it 's completely unacceptable that this happened 
in our National Health Service 
the report identifies 
seventy five recommendations nine for the Scottish government 
sixty five for the NHS boards 
and one for the Crown Office 
and let me be very clear 
I both accept them all 
and more importantly intend to address them all 
there are a number of the recommendations which will need to be worked through 
and others where we can go 
even further 
I want to ass- 
reassure you 
that the Scottish government and the NHS 
has n't been idle since the inquiry began 
and let me tell you what we have in place 
our national HEI task force drives the wide range of work required to ensure that we continue to improve and reduce 
HEIs 
in two thousand and nine we established an effective inspection process 
through the healthcare environment inspectorate 
it completes comprehensive unannounced inspections demanding urgent actions from boards 
where it 's required 
those inspections also provide key information which is used both nationally and locally 
to drive continuous improvement 
as an outbreak is defined as two or more cases timely local intervention is critical 
therefore there are robust systems in place enabling NHS boards to effectively recognise 
and manage outbreaks as they happen 
closing wards 
if required 
we expect outbreak concerns to be reported to health protection Scotland 
who will monitor the situation support the board 
and escalate to the Scottish government if needed 
work today has led to a significant reduction in C difficile rates across Scotland 's hospitals 
which have been at their lowest level this year with an eighty two percent 
reduction in C diff cases 
in the over-sixty-fives 
since 
two thousand and seven 
in addition hospital standardised mortality ratios are down 
by 
sixteen percent 
Lord MacLean 's report 
provides clear direction 
on how we can build 
further on this progress 
it 's encouraging to note that Lord MacLean identified that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde were quick to learn the lessons from the outbreak 
they 've continued to work hard to reduce the incidence of healthcare associated infections 
within their hospitals and now lead the way 
in reducing their occurrence 
I 've spoken to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde yesterday and today about the report 
and told them how I expect them 
to consider and address its findings 
although the focus is on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde today I have along with the Chief Executive of NHS Scotland written to all boards 
asking them to consider the implications of Lord MacLean 's report 
we 've requested that they report back to me 
by the nineteenth of January next year 
I 'd like to reassure you that many of the recommendations will have either been completed 
or are well under way 
I will establish an implementation group to consider all of the report 's recommendations for health boards and how they can be taken forward 
in partnership across 
the NHS 
I 've invited those affected or 
who 've lost 
loved ones to consider how 
they wish to be involved in taking forward the report 's findings 
this will help ensure 
that the memories of those who died continue 
to make lasting improvements 
in our NHS 
I 've asked the chief medical officer to lead the Scottish response for the UK five year anti-microbial 
strategy in association 
with the royal colleges and board medical directors 
to address and promote prudent prescribing 
of anti-microbials to 
reduce 
risk of d 
C diff infection 
and i 
anti-microbial resistance 
I 've also asked the chief nursing office to to work with board 
nurse directors to role out a robust quality assurance system 
putting patients families and their experience at the centre of this work 
ensuring it 's publicly available 
and easily accessible 
in the clinical environment 
additionally my chief nurse will work with them to role out nationally agreed standards for nursing documentation and care planning 
including a minimum data set for patient records 
this will be monitored as part of the ongoing quality assurance processes 
I 've written to the health and sport committee to offer to discuss the report in more detail 
and I 'll return to parliament 
with the Scottish government 's full response 
in the spring of next year 
as a minister now responsible for our NHS 
I 'm pledging 
my commitment 
to you today 
that we will take all necessary steps to ensure that a tragedy 
of this magni- 
magnitude 
can never 
happen again 
finally 
can I apologise again 
to the patients 
the families 
and relatives who were let down by our NHS 
at such a vulnerable 
time 
in their life
