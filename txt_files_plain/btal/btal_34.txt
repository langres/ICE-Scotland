it 's a particular pleasure to open this evening 's debate on Hamilton 's Accies exemplary community work 
and to have the opportunity to highlight the community initiatives 
being championed by the club 
by way of background Hamilton Academicals or Accies as they 're known locally was founded in eighteen seventy four by the rector 
and pupils of Hamilton Grammar School 
in two thousand one the club moved to its current grounds in New Douglas Park and it returned to the Scottish Premiership 
in two thousand and fourteen 
so whilst being very much aware of Accies as a local football club 
until I visited the club recently and presented certificates to the club 's apprentices 
as part of 
Skills Development Scotland 's Apprentice Week 
I had no idea 
of the extent of the youth engagement 
community work 
and the services the club provides for the local area 
so for example as part of the club 's Modern Apprenticeship programme 
run in condu- junction with SDS the apprenticeshi- apprentices 
take part in community coaching 
a programme which runs 
three days a week 
for children and young people aged four to fourteen 
this programme 
coaching programme 
connects with young people locally who may for various reasons be struggling to cope 
it then provides the opportunity for the young people to access 
and receive support from the enterprises and organisation the club supports 
other benefits and tangible achievements which the programme provides are 
increased fitness 
discipline 
and crucially 
mechanisms for coping 
with difficulties 
which the young people may 
be facing either at school 
or at home 
approximately 
a staggering eighty to one hundred and twenty children take part in the programme 
each week 
and they also have the opportunity to attend coaching camps in school holidays 
but their activity 
does n't stop there 
and their in-house Community Outreach Team 
oversees and helps to coordinate 
a diverse range of projects 
which are run from the grounds of the club 
members of the outra- reach team include Colin McGowan 
George Cairns 
Garry King Lisa Kerr Catriona McRoberts and Lynn Shaw 
and 
I 'm delighted so many of the Outreach team have managed along to the Scottish parliament 
to listen to tonight 's debate 
for it is abundantly clear to me 
that as in any successful organisation 
a key factor to that success 
is the people involved 
the Hamilton 
Accies Outreach Team 
is living proof of this fact 
so beyond the football pitch the club houses a rich variety 
of community activities including 
men 's sheds 
first launched in Aberdeen 
and now located in many areas of Scotland 
this initiative provides a social area and place for men many of whom have recently retired 
or become unemployed 
to gather and em- 
enjoy male company 
in their local community 
it also provides the opportunity to learn new skills in a workshop environment 
and the Hamilton one which is located and operated from within the stadium grounds 
is the first men 's shed in South Lanarkshire 
here men can try their hand at woodwork gardening 
and electronics 
and there 's also space to play board games 
share hobbies 
or simply 
socialise and enjoy the free refreshments 
it is 
hopeful erm it is to be hoped that following the positive experience of the Hamilton men 's shed 
more will be established in South Lanarkshire 
the club also works with families affected by autism 
the weekly Parents Carer support groups 
bring together a network established by the club of practitioners 
third sector businesses local charities 
and the NHS 
in order to provide 
resources 
and support for families affected by autism 
here once a week 
parents and carers get some real respite 
and feel less isolated 
by sharing advice 
and 
from the offer 
of support 
furthermore 
for over eight years the club has been running the Training for Freedom programme which supports prisoners prior to their being released 
these prisoners undertake working days at the club 
which help to develop social skills 
and increase their self-esteem 
participation in the programme also provides 
useful evidence 
of a commitment 
and a desire to work 
when the prisoner 's review is being considered by the parole vote 
so taking part in the programme prior to their being 
made for erm made eligible for parole 
helps these individuals 
reintegrate into society 
since two thousand eleven 
Soldiers Off The Street Scotland has been helping ex-service personnel 
who become homeless 
an estimated ten to twelve percent of rough sleepers in the UK 
are British Armed Forces veterans 
here again 
the club has stepped up to the plate 
and supports these homeless veterans in Hamilton 
finally Presiding Officer 
the football club 
grounds 
also host addiction programmes that are well-known to operate throughout Scotland these include 
Alcoholic Anonymous 
erm Cocaine Anonymous Gamblers Anonymous Alanon which is a support group for friends and families of alcoholics 
Narcotics Anonymous 
and the most recent addition 
is Families Anonymous 
which supports the families and friends of those with drug addiction 
with the family in mind the Blameless Charity was formed at the club 
to provide a space for fun 
and hope for the future 
for children and families affected by alcoholism and addiction 
this charity operates from the grounds of the stadium and has facilities 
to accommodate our community 
and recovery days 
open days including festivals festivals play days and away days 
I think the chamber 
will therefore agree 
that the community work being carried out at Hamilton Accies is truly exceptional 
also 
I consider important to stress here 
where other charities have struggled to engage with those vulnerable individuals in need of support 
football 
has acted as a hook to encouraging and actually seeing those hard-to-reach individuals 
take that first crucial step 
of walking through the club 's doors 
to access help 
there is no doubt 
Hamilton Accies has put in place a model of community involvement which with a good will and commitment 
of key personnel could 
and I hope will 
be replicated in football clubs across Scotland 
but in the meantime 
the Accies are 
most certainly 
to be congratulated
