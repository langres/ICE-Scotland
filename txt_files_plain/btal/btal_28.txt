winter is coming I must confess this opening remark is there for the titillation of the millions of arguably the most popular fantasy drama of our present age perhaps more accurately what I want to say is autumn is here for many of us our summer holiday will be a distant memory like many of the my fellow Scots it was the Mediterranean that was for me a source of healing balm and relaxation I do confess that this year on several occasions I looked out over the blue waters contemplating how for so many others this sea was not a source of leisure but was their final frontier it was a barrier to be crossed to deliver them from persecution and terror many of the world's great religions also experience the changing of seasons the Christian calendar so to speak is no different the words Advent Lent easter-tide and Christmas-tide are familiar to those even not with this tradition these seasons are peppered with feast days and saints' days such as Saint Andrew's day All Saints' day  and so on tomorrow is the feast of the holy rosary for many outside the Catholic faith the rosary may simply be understood as the beads that Catholics use to pray for Catholics the rosary's a powerful prayer tradition that focusses specifically on events of the Lord's life and ministry designed to help us in our vocation to follow the Lord the date of this feast day was chosen specifically because it is the anniversary of the battle of Lepanto in fifteen seventy one recalling when a coalition of European maritime states effectively prevented the Ottoman empire gaining access to the Atlantic and thus the Americas thwarting the invasion of Italy by a sultan who'd already taken possession of Contans- Constantinople the new Rome and who had uf- in fact already taken to himself the title the empor- of Rome the threat to Christian Europe was so great that pope Pius the fifth called for the recitation of the rosary throughout all of Europe today the stakes are just as high for those who'd profess to be Christian Europe's borders are drawing people and the dangers to what remains of Chris- the Christian fabric of this continent are very real but it's not a threat born out of invasion but indifference if Europe demonstrates indifference to the plight of refugees then the Christian heart will be torn from our nations with greater efficiency than the Ottoman force could have achieved I serve also as chairman of Saint Margaret's Children a family care society in two thousand and eleven one single letter concerning a hypothetical complaint endangered the good work of this charity as Oscar passionately but erroneously began to view our work as having nothing to do with faith with the support of this parliament the prevailing of common sense the Scottish charities appeal panel recognised and understood the nature of religiously inspired good works as protected by the European Convention of Human Rights the practice of one's religion cannot simply be reduced to prayers and chants in contemplating what we do at Saint Margaret's and the plight of refugees there is some great resonance with the challenge placed upon us  by Christ as recorded in Matthew's gospel Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or nak- a stranger or naked or sick in prison and did not minister to you and then he will answer them saying truly I say to you as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me or as we read in Saint James religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the father is this to care for orphans and widows the scope of this parliament might be limited in its powers when faced with international issues but that does not stop it being a voice which resonates true to our heritage and I praise the MSPs who have done so words are important and they have power often people of religious conviction are unable to act and effect change and words need to suffice these words have power and are often identified by another name prayer in respect to Europe may this parliament and nation be like the leaven in the bread may God bless our work
