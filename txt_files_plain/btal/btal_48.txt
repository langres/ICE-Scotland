there are cities 
that are more than just 
bricks and mortar 
cities 
built on ideals 
cities shaped by belief 
that the human experience can be greater 
tomorrow 
than it is today 
Edinburgh 
is one of those places 
graced with over four and a half thousand heritage-listed buildings 
the Scottish capital 
is one of the world 's most beautiful cities 
Edinburgh 's Old Town 
with its 
Royal Mile 
is filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants 
body snatchers and poets 
while it 's Georgian style 
New Town 
still shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment 
Edinburgh 
is studded with 
lofty crags 
and spectacular gardens 
and throughout the year 
hosts parties and festivals 
like no other 
to see Edinburgh 
in all her glory 
walk 
ride or 
even climb to Arthur 's Seat 
the highest of the city 's 
seven peaks 
some historians believe that this peak 
was the site of King Arthur 's legendary castle Camelot 
which is hardly surprising 
as Edinburgh 
has been at the clashing crossroads of history 
for millennia 
nearby 
on another volcanic crag 
rise the battlements of Edinburgh Castle 
the very 
symbol of Scotland itself 
over the last eleven centuries 
this castle has been laid siege to 
twenty six times 
as opposing clans 
kings 
and countries 
battled with broadsword 
and cannon 
but still it stands 
a testimony to the indomitable spirit 
of the Scots 
Edinburgh 
has a special place in the hearts of today 's monarchy 
the last of a long line of royal yachts 
her Majesty 's yacht 
Britannia 
sailed over a million miles before she was decommissioned in nineteen ninety seven 
today 
she 's permanently moored at Ocean Terminal 
a symbol of the Royal Family 's affection for Scotland 
and the people 
of Edinburgh 
Edinburgh 
has been the jewel in the crown of chieftains 
and royals 
for centuries 
but it 's also a place 
where old world chivalry 
continues today 
beneath a crown spire of Saint Giles ' cathedral 
is Thistle Chapel 
which honours the sixteen living knights and ladies of Scotland 's oldest order 
as well as those who came before 
it 's not just 
the brave and chivalrous who are celebrated in Edinburgh 
this is a city 
that has given the world some of its 
best-loved writers and stories 
in Princes Street Gardens 
rises the world 's 
largest monument to a writer 
dedicated 
to Sir Walter Scott 
who penned epics such as 
Ivanhoe 
and Rob Roy 
nearby 
at the Writers ' Museum 
learn more about Scott 
and two more of Scotland 's 
most cherished literary adventurers 
Robert Burns 
and Robert Louis Stevenson 
Edinburgh continues to cast a spell over 
contemporary writers too 
J K Rowling 
wrote the first two of her 
Harry Potter series 
in cozy Old Town nooks 
such as the Elephant House Cafe 
but history 
and literature aside 
perhaps the greatest gifts that Edinburgh has given humankind 
is in the field 
of knowledge 
which once earned the city 
the title 
the Athens of the North 
for over four centuries 
the University of Edinburgh 
has given us 
intellectual giants such as 
Charles Darwin 
David Hume and Alexander Bell 
explore centuries of innovation 
at the Scottish Museum 
or head to South Queensferry 
to see the Forth Bridge 
an engineering marvel when it opened in eighteen ninety 
and one which 
still takes the breath away today 
knowledge and beauty 
go hand in hand at the Royal Botanic Gardens too 
established in sixteen seventy 
this is one of the world 's 
oldest and most important centres of botanical science 
yet 
it 's a place which invites even 
the most hurried heart 
to slow down 
and swoon 
beauty 
is honoured at every turn in Edinburgh 
whether it be the elegant interiors of the Georgian House 
the priceless treasures within the Scottish National Gallery 
or the simple flower boxes 
which adorn the city 's pubs 
Edinburgh 
is a city that has given the world countless gifts 
but perhaps her greatest is this 
she shows us 
that all parts of the human experience 
the sciences and the arts 
the past 
and the present 
the sacred 
and the lighthearted 
all 
have equal value 
and that when brought together 
these things can create 
a beauty 
a state of mind 
a city 
like no other
