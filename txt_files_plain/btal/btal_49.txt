your Majesty Your Royal Highness distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen on behalf of my fellow MSPs can I welcome you and thank you for joining us at the opening of this the fifth session of the Scottish parliament Ceud Mìle Fàilte tha Pàrlamaid na h-Alba a particularly warm welcome to you Your Majesty and not just because of the significant milestones you have achieved this year your presence here today and the support you have given parliament from the beginning of devolution has helped this institution develop the authority it now enjoys and I know that many people across this country have enjoyed celebrating with you a remarkable year on your most recent official visit to Scotland you became our longest reigning monarch I was privileged to represent the parliament last month at Saint Paul's on the occasion of your ninetieth birthday celebrations the same day as the ninety fifth celebrations of Your Royal Highness Duke of Edinburgh and it was a enjoyable occasion made all the more delightful I may add when our First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced our Secretary of State David Mundell to your guests as her husband inadvertently I may add as the two had swapped places but as David Mundell himself observed we did not need a referendum to know that was one union doomed to disappointment from the start Your Majesty over nine decades you have witnessed so much extraordinary social and economic change phenomenal scientific and technological advances disturbing and ever-increasing environmental anxiety but critically you have seen successive generation rise to the challenges that lie before them Your Majesty the parliament before you today stands ready for the challenges that lie ahead of us every MSP in this chamber is proud to represent the people of Scotland we have been given the opportunity to serve and to contribute in a parliament which has been refreshed two out of every five MSPs here has been elected for the first time rejuvenating our democracy reminding us of the promise of devolution to work together across party lines for the good of all in these few short weeks weeks of unprecedented political turbulence I've already seen a real willingness to work together cooperatively and collaboratively I've seen the emergence of a shared agenda to clarify the identity and the role of this parliament a shared recognition that it is more important than ever that this parliament finds its voice a voice for hope to echo Donald Dewar a voice for the future and I say more important than ever because these last few weeks have also borne witness to the politics of hate today outside this parliament we fly the rainbow flag of pride testimony to the forty nine lives lost in the senseless shootings in an Orlando nightclub a flag which displays our solidarity with the families and the communities they left behind we continue to mourn the loss of our parliamentary colleague Jo Cox and I believe it is simply not good enough to condemn such atrocities we have been given the privilege of public office and we need to lead by example just this week President Michael D Higgins of Ireland spoke to this chamber and he warned us against the growth of a temporary inchoate populism and he urged us not to react in kind but to respond with an open informed tolerant and engaged discourse it was one of the most erudite and powerful arguments for empathy for the importance of political sympathy I've ever had the privilege to hear yes our exchanges in this parliament should be passionate and robust but they should also be respectful courtesy compassion and gentleness are signs of strength not of weakness a lesson many of us could learn from the example of Your Majesty when this building was first constructed Edwin Morgan described the open and adventurous parliament Scotland wanted to see in his poem Open the Doors and he implored us not to let our hope be other than great I have never given up hope that we can recapture the new kind of politics from which this parliament was born but it takes determination to move away from the trench warfare of party lines it takes real purpose if we are to soften the new binary divisions yes or no leave or remain we need to remember and act on the principles on which we were founded accessible transparent in our proceedings sharing power and it cannot and must not be simply today that the parliament opens its doors to the people of Scotland last Friday morning we all awoke to the monumental impact of the EU referendum result an event which has already had a profound and dramatic impact on the political landscape but I will also re- remember that date as my daughter Annie's last day at primary school and as she moves on to High School I want her I want all our children not to be filled with anxiety I want her to grow up full of e- expectation and excitement secure in the knowledge that we are shaping a positive future for them I want them to study and learn to work and to prosper to play to laugh to fall in love in a world in which our humanity can live up to the deepest meaning of the word Your Majesty amid some of the bad news over the last month there was at least one little moment of joy when your horse Dartmouth won at Royal Ascot we shared your undisguised pleasure on our TV screens and politics is a little like horseracing in that it can often strike people with the triumph of hope over experience but despite the public cy- cynisism in my experience most politicians are incurable optimists and seventeen years ago almost to this day I took my place I was filled with hope as I took my place in the first Scottish parliament and as I stand here again today I can feel that fire rekindled in my heart we stand at the brink of a new session with all the hope and promise that can bring we have five years to make a difference five years to make Scotland a fairer kinder and more prosperous country five years to build a better place for us all to live government or opposition front or back bench each one of us has something to contribute for as Jo Cox said in her maiden speech in the Commons we have far more in common than that which divides us my hope like the poet's is still great Your Majesty can I call on you to address this meeting of parliament
