this section of the resource is designed to provide a very brief introduction to the sources of law 
and to the Scottish 
legal system 
which exists as a separate system 
with many differences from the rest of the United Kingdom 
these i- 
differences include 
a different court system 
differences in the legal profession 
as well as differences in other areas of law 
some of which we 'll look at 
later on 
until seventeen oh seven of course 
Scotland had a separate parliament and legal system 
from the rest of what is now 
the United Kingdom 
and in that time 
the law in Scotland had 
in a number of ways developed differently 
from that 
in 
the rest of the UK 
examples include the law about property 
the Law of Contract 
succession law 
and a law about what we would now 
describe as 
adults with incapacity 
as part of the 
Act of Union 
of seventeen 
oh seven 
which unified the parliaments of Scotland and England 
protection was given to Scots private law 
which is this ancient law about relationships between 
individuals 
including corporate individuals 
and this includes for example Family Law 
and the law about Adults with Incapacity 
and this protection 
preserve 
these differences for 
the future 
after the union 
in seventeen oh seven 
and until the new Scottish parliament was created 
towards the end of the 
twentieth century 
Scots law relevant to social 
work practice 
developed 
in 
two 
ways 
first 
entirely separate development 
for example Mental Health Law 
the law about Adults with Incapacity 
and much of the law about children and families 
is entirely separate 
from 
i- 
the law 
in the rest of the United Kingdom 
and is 
quite different 
from it 
secondly 
identical provision 
in some cases 
the same piece of legislation 
applies 
throughout 
the United Kingdom 
relevant examples are the Human Rights Act 
and the 
Equality Act 
of 
twenty ten 
which give the same rights across 
all 
of the United Kingdom 
in other cases 
the same rules were introduced 
but are part 
of 
different pieces of legislation 
one example 
is the law relating to community care 
when this was introduced 
in England and Wales 
the legal basis 
was the NHS and Community Care Act 
of 
nineteen ninety 
which has now 
in fact 
been replaced by the Care Act 
of twenty fourteen 
in Scotland 
the law 
was 
and is 
found 
in 
the Social Work Scotland Act 
nineteen sixty eight 
as we shall see 
shortly 
since the new Scottish parliament 
was inaugurated 
in 
nineteen ninety nine 
it has had the power 
to 
legislate on most areas of concern 
relating to 
Social Work practice 
allowing for 
independent legal development 
and 
for increasing divergence from the rest of the United Kingdom 
for example 
in relation to law 
about 
children 
this 
together with the point made earlier about separate development 
explain why caution is necessary 
in looking at social work texts 
written 
for 
an English audience 
and assuming 
that the law which is stated in there 
also applies 
to Scotland 
in many cases it wo n't 
the law 'll be different 
or it will have 
a different 
legal 
basis 
so 
that 's 
a brief introduction to the legal system 
the next question is 
where 
does law 
come from 
the most important source 
is 
legislation 
and legislation includes Acts of Parliament 
whether 
of 
the 
United Kingdom 
or the Scottish parliament 
and these Acts of Parliament are sometimes 
referred to as 
statutes 
and it also includes 
delegated 
legislation 
a more minor role 
is played by precedent 
that is law which is created by the courts 
and 
in practice 
by guidance from the Scottish government 
or other organisations 
such as 
the Equality 
and Human Rights 
Commission 
let 's start 
by 
looking at 
Acts of Parliament 
slide one shows part of section twelve A of the Social Work Scotland Act 
and 
I 'll refer to that from now on 
as the nineteen sixty eight 
Act 
all Acts are divided 
up into sections 
and this particular section illustrates a number of important points about Acts 
and about legislation more generally 
it provides the statutory basis for the carrying out of Community Care assessments 
and the obligation of local authorities to take account of these 
in deciding on provision of services 
this is a more general implication 
social work in a public sector setting is only possible 
to the extent that it is required 
or authorised by legislation 
there must always be a statutory basis for local authority actions 
and therefore 
the actions of social workers employed by them 
this section 
was added in 
to the nineteen sixty eight Act by 
the NHS and Community Care Act 
nineteen ninety 
and has been amended since then 
the part in italics 
was added 
by the Community Care 
and Health 
Scotland Act 
two thousand and two 
to replace 
text 
that was there previously 
legislation 
is never static 
it is common for it to be amended 
to have bits added to it 
or bits removed 
the nineteen sixty eight Act 
as it has legal effect today 
is very different 
from 
the 
Act 
which was passed 
in nineteen sixty eight 
third 
point 
is that legislation 
whether in the form of Acts 
or of delegated legislation 
calls for interpretation 
here for example 
what does it mean to say that someone has a need 
and this has been 
a contentious issue 
what are 
Community Care services 
and what does it mean 
for a carer to provide a substantial amount of care 
on a regular basis 
and how 
is any assessment of needs 
to be carried out 
the answers to one of these questions 
is found in the nineteen sixty eight Act 
which defines 
Community Care 
services 
in another section 
it is common 
to find terms and phrases defined 
in legislation 
though care 
can sometimes be needed 
the Children Scotland Act 
nineteen ninety five 
defines child in different ways 
for different purposes 
beyond this 
help can be found 
in interpreting 
legislation 
in guidance given by the Scottish government 
for example 
about the process of assessment 
and how it should be carried out 
it should be noted 
that 
this guidance does not to the force of law 
but courts will still consider it 
of what the local authority has done 
and how it has done it 
is challenged 
finally 
some issues about meaning 
are litigated in court 
and judgements have shed light on 
for example 
the meaning of need 
and the relevance of local authority resources 
at various stages in the assessment 
and decision making process 
finally 
although it is not obvious from the extract 
it does illustrate a further point about legislation 
just because 
an Act has been passed by parliament 
and been given as required 
the Royal assent 
does n't mean it immediately becomes law 
in order for that to happen 
it has to be commenced 
or brought into effect 
for example 
a law 
section 
twelve A was passed in nineteen ninety 
it only came into effect 
in April 
nineteen 
ninety three 
delays in implementation of new legislation are common 
for example 
time may be needed to train staff 
or to set up new administrative arrangements 
or to make delegated legislation 
containing 
more 
detailed rules 
and it 's to delegated legislation 
that we now 
turn 
the 
first piece of text on slide 
two 
comes from the Children Scotland Act 
nineteen ninety five 
as you can see 
it gives power to the Scottish ministers 
to make regulations about what a local authority 's 
specific duties are 
in respect of children 
who are looked after 
these regulations 
are described as delegated legislation 
the detail of the rules is not in the Act 
but the Scottish ministers are given the power by parliament to make these rules 
in other words 
the power to make law is delegated to them 
hence the name 
in some cases 
the regulations will have to be approved 
or at least not disapproved 
by parliament 
the laws 
which are usually described as regulations 
or 
rules 
made by ministers 
have exactly the same legal effect 
as an Act of Parliament 
despite being made 
under 
delegated powers 
the second piece of text on slide four 
is from regulations made under section seventeen 
of 
the Children Scotland Act 
nineteen ninety five 
and these are 
The Looked After Children 
Scotland Regulations 
of two thousand 
and nine 
as you can see 
and as is suggested earlier 
these provide more detail about 
the 
local authorities ' obligations 
and an important input in the Act 
into practice 
finally I say something about the other two sources of law 
that 
I mentioned earlier 
I 've already mentioned 
guidance 
and there 's a substantial quantity of it in existence across all of the law relating to Social Work practice 
in the area of community care 
there is for example 
the guidance already mentioned 
on assessment 
guidance in assessment of carers 
guidance in self-directed support 
and guidance on free personal care 
one of the areas where Scotland 
diverges from England 
now as I 've said 
guidance 
is not 
legally binding 
but there is an expectation 
that 
social workers 
employed by local authorities will behave consistently 
with this 
central government 
guidance 
finally 
precedent 
precedent simply describes the development of rules 
through 
court judgement 
the reason this has happened is that judges are bound to follow earlier decisions 
which deal 
with 
the same 
legal issue 
and which were decided by a court 
higher up the court hierarchy 
and we look 
at the court hierarchy 
later on 
there are some areas of law 
which have been almost entirely developed in this way 
for example 
the law about liability for negligence 
but in our context 
earlier decisions 
are mainly useful 
in providing interpretations 
of statutory 
provisions
