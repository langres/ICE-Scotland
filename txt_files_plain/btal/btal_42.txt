the two statistical accounts of Scotland covering the seventeen nineties and eigtheen thirties are among the best contemporary reports of life during the agricultural and industrial revolutions in Europe the Statistical Accounts of Scotland provide a rich record of a wide variety of topics wealth and poverty climate agriculture and wildlife and even the moral health of the people the accounts are of interest to a range of audiences from academics from a range of subjects local historians family genealogists through to school children studying the history of their local area the first accounts were instigated by Sir John Sinclair member of Parliament for Caithness he wanted a collection of information about the economic and social activities and the natural resources of Scotland he sent surveys containing a hundred and sixty six questions to nearly a thousand parish ministers in seventeen ninety some of the ministers' responses were long in coming back but eventually after sending statistical missionaries to hurry up late entries and a final demand written in red ink the twenty one volumes of the parish reports were completed nine years later Sir John was sure that his collection of well-ordered facts would form an account of the quantum of happiness of the communities of Scotland and also be a means of future improvement in eighteen thirty two the clergy were once again asked to describe their parishes it felt that the time was right for a new edition because of the great changes which had taken place in Scotland since the seventeen nineties the new statistical account was written mostly in the eighteen thirties finally being issued as fifteen volumes in eighteen forty five the Statistical Accounts of Scotland service was launched by Edina ten years ago in two thousand and one inside the services users can search for information using their parish name if they've got a particular subject they're interested in they can do a word search and the information is shown in context once a user has put the information that they're looking for say the parish name into the search box they'll have to choose whether or not they use the first or second account after that the information they see is the digitised image of the erm account for that parish it's possible to look at a transcript of the parish at the same time which will then allow you to do cutting and pasting you can print the entire PDF of the parish or you can print individual pages the information you can find in the accounts is surprisingly detailed so for example in the parish of Linlithgow there's information about the number of individuals who were employed in the shoemaking industry about a hundred and previously over twenty four thousand pairs of shoes a year had been im- exported to America now times were harder and the shoes were being sent to the poor of Edinburgh or in fact were being sent to soldiers abroad as I mentioned previously users can search for individual words now tea drinking was considered to be a pernicious habit amongst ladies in the poorer class during the seventeen nineties so if you search for tea drinking you'll be able to see erm examples of the ministers' disapproval of this very bad habit set in context amongst the additional resources available within statistical accounts service there are thirty two maps that have been included in the accounts now these maps are one of s- among some of the earliest maps produced for Scotland so in the example that we see there's a map of a coloured map of Linlithgow subscriptions to the service can be taken out by individuals or universities colleges or any other organisations in the UK or abroad the service is invaluable to those interested in this period of Scottish history and the level of usage demonstrates its popularity
