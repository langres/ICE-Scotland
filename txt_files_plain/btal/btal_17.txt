Deeps- Presiding Officer it's an honour for the first time as First Minister to present this government's programme for the year ahead I pledged last week that I would be First Minister for all of Scotland it follows therefore that this is a programme for all of Scotland of course Presiding Officer it's no secret that I support independence erm passionately and that I want to see substantial new powers transferred to this parliament and we will find out tomorrow if the Smith Commission will recommend proposals that meet the pre-referendum vow of the Westminster parties to deliver a powerhouse Scottish parliament one thing is certain this parliament and this government will use any new powers it gets wisely and to improve the lives of the people we serve indeed one early commitment I want to make today is this if the necessary powers are transferred in good time to this parliament the government will bring forward legislation to extend the franchise and allow all sixteen and seventeen year-olds to vote in the twenty sixteen Scottish election Presiding Officer the debate about more powers will continue and rightly so however that debate is not the focus of my statement today instead the clear focus of this programme for government is on how we use our existing powers fully creatively and constructively in the interest of all those we serve this is our legislative and policy programme for one year it proposes twelve new bills and a range of policy interventions it builds on the strong foundations of this government and also sets out a number of longer-term priorities it aims to build a sense of shared endeavour about how we create a wealthier and a more equal society and it's founded on three key priorities participation prosperity and fairness let me start firstly Presiding Officer with participation in the last year we have seen engagement in politics in this country on a scale unprecedented in the recent history of this island that didn't happen because the referendum created something new but because it spoke to something enduring the desire the shared desire to build a better country we need to find new ways of harnessing that democratic energy not just in the great constitutional questions of our time but also in the day-to-day decisions made by and for our communities I intend that my government will lead by example the cabinet will hold more public discussions meeting outside of Edinburgh more often and in the first of what will be regular facebook sessions I'll be taking questions from the public online later this evening I intend that we will be an open and accessible government but we all know that fostering a sense of participation is about much more than consulting it's also about handing decision-making powers back to communities I want to ensure that more of the money we spend is directed by communities themselves by the individuals and the organisations who know best how to harness the energy of local people I can therefore announce that we will establish a new empowering communities fund encompassing our existing people and communities fund it will have an additional ten million pounds to allocate next year more than doubling the existing resource and be available directly to communities we'll also take forward our manifesto commitment to establish an independent commission to examine fairer alternatives to the current system of council tax we will establish the commission in partnership with local authorities through CoSLA and invite all political parties to be involved in it and I hope all political parties will accept that invitation erm I intend that the commission will start its work in early two thousand and fifteen and report by the autumn the council tax freeze it will Presiding Officer as promised by this government remain in place for the duration of this parliament Presiding Officer our commitment to empowerment I believe must reach every part of Scotland last week I appointed a minister with specific responsibility for the islands today I can announce that we will reconvene the island areas working group to draw up an implementation plan for devolution of powers to our islands taking account of those powers we hold now and any that are forthcoming as a result of the Smith process we will then consult on the contents of an islands bill so that we can give effect to our commitments erm the government also intends to embark on a radical programme of land reform Presiding Officer Scotland's land must be an asset that benefits the many not the few next week we'll publish a policy statement on land rights and responsibilities and begin consultation on a range of proposals to be included in our land reform bill that bill will be part of a wider programme of reform and before its introduction we'll set out a response to all sixty two of the land reform review group's recommendations however it's intended that the following key proposals will be amongst those included in the bill erm firstly powers for ministers to intervene where the scale of land ownership or the conduct of a landlord is acting as a barrier to sustainable development and secondly the establishment of a Scottish land reform commission at Dudley measures to improve the transparency and accountability of land ownership and make information on land its value and its ownership more readily available in one place and next action to ensure that charities holding large areas of land are under an obligation to engage with local communities erm and lastly the removal of business rates exemptions for shooting and deer stocking estates these exemptions were put in place by the Tories in nineteen ninety four to protect the interests of major land owners ending these exemptions will help this government to more than treble the Scottish land fund from three million pounds this year to ten million pounds a year from twenty sixteen and that will help to ensure delivery of our target of having one million acres of land in community ownership by twenty twenty
