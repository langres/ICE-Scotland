thank you very much indeed erm Presiding Officer I'm grateful for the opportunity to update parliament today on the important issue of Ebola members will be aware that we've responded to questions in the chamber on this subject earlier this year and last week I provided an update in writing to the opposition health spokespeople and the health and sport committee however the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is an issue of such international importance it is right and proper that I make a statement to provide reassurance on where Scotland stands the situation in West Africa is grave what we are seeing is nothing short of a public health disaster in the affected countries the World Health Organisation publishes weekly updates on cases and deaths the latest information from the twenty fifth of October is that there have been a total of one erm of ten thousand one hundred and forty one cases of Ebola with four thousand nine hundred and twenty two deaths historically the disease has been confined to rural and more dispersed communities in Central Africa where they cannot easily take hold but the outbreak in West Africa is affecting urban communities with large densely packed populations areas where people move about regularly and countries to varying degrees with challenges around health infrastructure and leadership once Ebola had a fingerhold in this part of the continent earlier this year it did begin to spread very rapidly there is no sign yet that the epidemic is under control where Scotland will play our full part in contributing to the international effort along with our friends in the rest of the UK and elsewhere to bring it under control in West Africa erm already I'm aware of more than fifty professionals from NHS Scotland who have already offered to help and in some cases are in situ in West Africa it is likely more support will be needed and I've written to the NHS chief executives on the sixteenth of October to reiterate their support for volunteers and to particularly identify the need for more nurses and lab technicians I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Scottish aid workers operating in the region and the many health care workers and other staff who have expressed their willingness to volunteer in West Africa clearly we need to know that any of our volunteers travelling to West Africa will be safe and in partnership with Health Protection Scotland I am reassured that robust arrangements are in place to do this we know who's going to West Africa we know erm they will be trained well before they go and when they arrive we're confident they'll be looked after when they're there and we know they will be monitored and supported when they return within Scotland we are lucky enough to have the resources and infrastructure and the public health expertise and experience to put us in a good position to deal with any serious infectious diseases but we're not complacent there has been an increase in concern about Ebola in the last few weeks prompted by the reports of transmissions of the disease to health care staff in Spain and the United States however it is important we understand the reality of the risk the fear of Ebola can be more infectious than the virus itself the risk of a case arriving in Scotland is very low there are no direct flights to Scotland from the affected countries and robust exit screening is now in place in the three affected countries entrance screening is in place at Heathrow and Gatwick as well as in key European hubs such as Paris and Brussels even u- if a case does appear within Scotland or the UK it is very unlikely we'll see any transmission of the virus the disease can only be caught through blood and other body fluids and affected individuals will be unwell and have a fever and other symptoms that are not infectious but which will lead them to health care well before they're likely to pass the virus to other people indeed the greatest risk of Ebola is to health care workers because they're more likely to come into contact with body fluids  when treating a patient so we must keep the risks in perspective but we must also be ready to respond and that's why we've been working with the NHS to ensure they're prepared and ready my colleague Michael Matheson the minister for public health has led this work since early summer when he met personally with experts from Health Protection Scotland following this we established a viral hemorrhagic fevers national group chaired by Health Protection Scotland to ensure all the necessary arrangements and contingency plans are in place that group met for the first time in August and since last week the group has started meeting on a weekly basis given the importance of ensuring we can quickly identify and diagnose possible cases of Ebola we have provided funding to NHS Lothian to introduce a national testing service for viral hemorrhagic fevers in Scotland that service which will be in place from the first of December means that blood samples will no longer need to be sent to the south of England for testing and we will have the results more quickly we're also working closely with the infectious disease clinical community to ensure the facilities and resources are in place to rapidly respond to a potential case our main infectious disease units in Glasgow and Lanarkshire in the west Edinburgh in the east and Aberdeen in the north are ready to operate as regional centres of expertise providing advice advice to other local hospitals or clinicians as needed and managing possible cases our many other infectious disease specialists in wards around Scotland are also ready to respond if needed I'm confident that we're ready to safely manage any possible case should one emerge and indeed we've already shown that our health boards working with the Scottish ambulance service and others can safely manage these these types of infections we safely managed a case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Glasgow in two thousand and twelve we have fourteen isolation rooms available to manage patients with Ebola in the three regional infectious disease units in Scotland and access to many more specialist facilities across the UK an important strand of our work is ensuring that everybody across the national health service in Scotland and any other relevant professionals have all the information they need as well and I'm grateful to Health Protection Scotland and the other professionals involved for all the work they have done in the past few months to update the many different pieces of guidance and technical advice in relation to Ebola this information is all available on the Health Protection Scotland website and I will encourage all health professionals to ensure they're familiar with the content there it is very likely that any questions they may have will already have been answered on the website I've already mentioned the entry screening in place in the UK and European hubs I am in regular contact with my ministerial contacts in the rest of the UK in both the Scotland office and the department of health and we will keep under review the need for any additional entry screening including in Scotland I'm not yet convinced that this is proportionate or necessary but I am ready to implement screening if our assessment changes we also have to make sure that our international partners across Europe are keeping under review the question of screening and other public health measures discussions are already taking place at a European level in all these matters we're also working with the oil and gas industry to ensure that any of our oil and gas workers coming or going to affected countries will have access to the same type and quality of monitoring arrangements which are in place for medical volunteers that international joined-up approach is vital if we are to successfully tackle this outbreak across the world countries need to pull together and we in Scotland are keen to play our part earlier this year this government donated half a million pounds to the World Health O-d World Health Organisation's Ebola response this was not a one-off gesture last week I announced an additional donation of three hundred thousand pounds worth of medical equipment and supplies to West Africa from Scotland this includes includes over one hundred thousand respirators and one million disposable aprons which will be distributed to charities running clinics in Sierra Leone I will continue to ensure we offer every assistance we can to the international effort the best way for us to protect the public health in Scotland is to support the efforts under way in West Africa in conclusion Presiding Officer I hope I provided the sufficient reassurance that we're monitoring the situation closely and we take the public health of Scotland very seriously the government's resilience committee SGoR chaired by the First Minister has already met three times on this matter this has provided an opportunity for us to engage with the Scottish experts and to ensure direct government oversight over preparedness and we will continue to be vigilant and alert and we will maintain the links with other parts of the UK to ensure a joined-up approach the public should be reassured that the risk of Ebola coming to Scotland is still very low but it if it does arrive here the National Health Service is ready to respond and public health will be protected thank you
