good afternoon this week there are debating chambers governing bodies meeting at each end of Edinburgh's Royal Mile and yet the work that we do is certainly not miles apart each making policy that either changes life for the better leaves folk in their difficulties or adds burdens to those already hurt and down and without lifting a finger to help we're each given the privilege and the responsibility to look after people from all walks of life to be a place of hope for now and also for the future today's World Mission Council report call recall David Livingstone's theology that every one of every nation is equal in the eyes of God who made them and he describes slavery which is that which deemed one to be better than another as an open sore on the face of Africa most now see the error of past ways regarding slavery apartheid gender sexuality as divisions which really should no longer exist but more healing is still required there are pains that run deep when you are told that you are not good or that you are not as good as others or when rich world governments refuse to pass laws that allow the hungry to be fed that's not the way of the gospel and nor should it be the way of any ecclesiastical nor national governance but rather we in church and nation are called to stand with the marginalised seeing needs hearing cries for help bringing justice being the voice of the voiceless being fair and treating all people exactly the same it is the presence of justice and compassion which proves any government's worth the decisions that they make which bring dignity and equality and shout loud and clear that every life is precious are those which bring honour and that is Jesus' radical gospel of love he calls us to the margins to take risks to face challenges to use opportunities and to be out there on that slippery slope with those who are struggling to hold on rather than hold on to the power that we have ourselves on Sunday the church of Scotland celebrated her faith at Heart and Soul in Princess Street Gardens we also celebrated Pentecost which is receiving God's spirit in a new way fresh and invigorating stirring us out of complacency to be the people of his radical wonderful and inclusive gospel may that spirit hope may that spirit stir us and may that spirit lead us all wherever we may be let us pray Lord Jesus bless this parliament with wisdom and compassion with care in speech and action bless each one with mercy and humility and may your peace justice and love prevail amen
