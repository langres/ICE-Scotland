Alexander Bean to give him his proper name is said to have been the son of an East Lothian ditch digger a shiftless lad who deciding that the hard labour of the family business was not for him eloped at a young age with a woman known as Black Agnes Douglas some accounts paint Agnes as a passive figure enthralled with Sawney's dangerous yet charismatic personality others paint her as a witch and a murderer in her own right before she ever set eyes on Sawney even going as far to implicate her unnatural sexual and culinary desires as the original impetus for some of the horrors that followed all agree however that the pair finally settled here at Bennane Head in what was then the Earldom of Carrick Sawney turned first to robbery to provide for himself his lover and soon his young family as a highway man he would have stalked the highways and byways of this desolate countryside waylaying  coaches and solitary travellers and taking their food and valuables by force in this time period all across the country such attacks were common enough that few travellers set forth unarmed anyone making a successful career as a bandit would be no stranger to fighting and killing for their loot and Sawney threw himself wholeheartedly into the business of indiscriminate murder he developed a policy of leaving no survivors dead men after all tell no tales time passed and Sawney Bean and his lover withdrew entirely from the world of civilisation if the towns people of the nearby villages ever knew of their presence they were forgotten or were assumed to have moved on travellers continued to disappear but this was after all a wild place in a wild time a land of hardship and violence where life was cheaper enough and much shorter than it is today so their activities did not immediately draw much attention but as the years went on the toll of the missing grew into the hundreds and eventually gruesome evidence began to surface that something more sinister was at work than wolves or passing thieves Girvan Beach a few miles north of Bennane Head home to beautiful sands a quaint harbour and views across to the islands of Arran and Ailsa Craig on a clear day you can even see the coast of Northern Ireland but so the story goes sometime in the late fifteenth century after a big storm you might have been treated to a rather less idyllic scene whenever the storm tides receded the sands would be littered with human body parts limbs torsos skulls and rather than simply decomposing many of the skeletal remains showed signs of having been stripped off the skin and muscle tissue like the slaughtered carcasses of animals it's almost enough to put you off your ice cream despite this searches by the local authorities turned up nothing and so for several more years the sinister objects washing up on Girvan's beaches remained a disturbing mystery then one summer a travelling fair came to Galloway people from miles around flocked to visit it and so one evening a young couple whose names are not recorded happened to be travelling home along a small deserted lane not far from Bennane Head as twilight settled around them they were ambushed not by a highway man or a band of brigands but by a ravening hoard  of savages an eighteenth century account of what followed can be found in one edition of the Newgate Calendar a series of biographical publications about notorious criminals a sort of true-crime magazine of its day the man  to save himself as well as he could fought very bravely against them with sword and pistol riding some of them down by main force of his horse in the conflict the poor woman fell from behind him and was instantly murdered before her husband's face for the female cannibals cut her throat and fell to sucking her blood with as great a gust as if it had been wine
 this done they ripped up her belly and pulled out all her entrails such a dreadful spectacle made the man make the more obstinate resistance as expecting the same fate if he fell into their hands it pleased Providence while he was thus engaged that twenty or thirty from the same fair came together in a body upon which Sawney Bean and his bloodthirsty clan withdrew and made the best of their way towards a thick wood to their den this man who was the first that had ever fallen in their way and come off alive  told the whole company what had happened and showed them the horrid spectacle of his wife whom the murderers had dragged to some distance but had not time to carry her entirely off they who were all struck with stupefaction and amazement at what he related took him with them to Glasgow and told the affair to the provost of that city who immediately sent to the King concerning it most versions of the tale conclude with the King himself most likely King James the First of Scotland riding from Edinburgh at the head of four hundred men to uproot the evil that had taken seed at Bennane the Bean's only survivor served as the guide along with a pack of bloodhounds at first they found nothing and almost missed the entrance but then the hounds sniffed out the mouth of a cave partly hidden in the cliffside the soldiers charged in and the horrors they found would become the stuff of legend legs arms hands thighs and feet hung up in rows like dried beef barrels of pickled limbs lined the walls gold silver jewellery the possessions of their victims littered the floor and then there was the family at the time of capture the family of cannibals that inhabited this cave numbered forty eight Sawney Bean Black Agnes fourteen children and thirty two grandchildren each one the product of incest down here over twenty five years in the primordial darkness of the earth amidst the smell of freshly butchered meat the seed of a civilised man had degenerated into something no longer human in the most common account of the clan's destruction the King's men rounded up the cannibals and had them transported to Edinburgh where they were found too subhuman to stand trial the men were castrated their genitals were thrown into a fire their hands and limbs were cut off and they were left on a scaffold to bleed to death the women folk were forced to watch this  before being burned at the stake another version holds that the king was so disgusted and disturbed by what he saw in the cave that he ordered his men to dynamite the entrance then and there sealing forty eight cannibals men women and children into the dark belly of the cliffside that they called their home to starve or suffocate in darkness you almost wonder who you're supposed to be rooting for this at least is the legend but how much of it if any is true it's tough to separate fact from fiction in this case the tale of Sawney Bean is just so tied up in tourist bait and bogeyman stories and folkore well some historians believe that there may be a grain of truth to the tale most are sceptical pointing to the fact that there is just no evidence for thousands of disappearances along the Galloway Coast in this period and likewise nothing to corroborate these spectacular mass executions in Edinburgh of the Bean Clan
 one scholarly theory actually posits that Daniel Defoe of all people concocted the Sawney Bean story as a kind of  anti-Scottish blood libel during the Jacobean conflict in an attempt to label Scots as layabouts and savages but whatever the truth there is no denying the cultural impact of the story
