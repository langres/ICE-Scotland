we 're delighted to see so many of you here today in what is 
a very very fitting venue 
erm the purpose of The Big Green Challenge is to encourage debate 
on one of the most important issues 
today 
energy 
so where does that energy come from 
where will it come from in the future 
how can we maintain the lifestyles we enjoy today 
while being kinder to the environment 
erm undoubtedly 
there is a role 
for renewable energy but what role should that be 
and what about all the challenges 
erm are we doing enough to secure 
our future energy supply 
could Scotland and the Highlands and Islands 
be doing more 
erm 
what is there to gain 
from renewable energy development 
economically 
and within all our communities 
so these are all questions that have been debated at the very highest levels in fact 
right here in the Scottish parliament 
MSPs are discussing these very points 
erm and HIE is delighted 
to be supporting a competition 
that gets young people talking 
about this important subject 
the very people 
that are going to be making some of 
fai- the very very tough decisions that erm will come before us round in 
energy consumption 
our energy sources 
and our energy generation in the future 
so the BGC The Big Green Challenge 
so it is a part of a wider awareness 
erm raising campaign that HIE is running 
to ensure that the people of the Highlands and Islands 
are 
informed about the issues 
and about the opportunities 
erm and are supportive of the development of the sector 
erm we need the public to support projects 
in the right locations 
that make the most of our natural resources 
and our talented workforce and infrastructure 
to ensure the maximum benefit 
for the economy of the region 
and its communities 
and HIE is committed to the growth 
of the renewable energy sector 
erm but we are very aware 
that there are challenges and issues to be overcome 
not least the national grid 
to acknowledge the development 
and ensure you may have enough people 
to meet the workforce needs of this emerging sector 
so I 'm 
really very much looking forward 
to listening 
to the debates 
erm and as has been the case at previous Big Green Challenge events 
I 'm sure that I will learn 
erm many new things 
actually 
so joining me on the judging panel today we have 
Mike MacKenzie 
MSP for the Highlands and Islands 
we have Niall Caldwell 
managing director Artemis 
Intelligent Power limited 
and 
Greg Clark 
public affairs manager at SSC Renewables 
so welcome to the judges 
thank you very much 
and I 'm now delighted to welcome and introduce our host 
for the day 
Heather Reid OBE 
BBC Scotland 's former chief weather forecaster and presenter who 's very affectionately known as Heather the Weather 
I think that belies Heather 's erm 
quite erm inspiring achievements in science education 
erm her background is in physics and she 's highly involved in science in stem projects 
erm across the country 
erm so a really truly inspiring individual in terms of her career and how she is 
erm inspiring future generations too 
erm so she w- erm 
specialises in promoting 
climate change and renewable energy 
and I 'm sure you have a cha- 
a chance to chat to Heather 
erm this afternoon and hear her views 
on these important topics 
there 's also a special prize this year which we 're very excited about and that 's donated by Artemis Intelligent Power 
erm and it 's for the best 
understanding of renewable energy technology 
Artemis is a small charity fund 
one of its objectives is to stimulate young people to study engineering 
and the prize will be awarded to the team whose argument shows 
the 
greatest depth of understanding 
of renewable technology 
and I 'm really looking forward to hearing from Niall 
later 
when he erm presents his prize 
erm because I think he 'll have lots of inspiring messages 
for you 
so 
all that remains for me to do is 
to 
wish 
all our finalists the very best of luck it 's a fantastic achievement to be here at all 
erm so we 're very delighted to welcome you
