thank you so much 
it 's a great pleasure to be involved in this 
genuinely visionary project 
and I think the Royal Society is very much to be commended 
erm for for getting this going 
and it 's also great to have a key meeting like this taking place in Edinburgh 
it 's very pleasing 
erm 
right now we are going to do a bit of time travelling 
and I 'm going to be telling you 
what things are going to be like in 
twenty 
the twenty thirties 
and 
that 's actually not exactly true 
these scenarios 
are not intended to be a prediction of a future 
erm but the fact that we ca n't 
predict the future is itself relevant 
and is something that I 'll return to in a moment 
and 
even though the scenarios do n't claim to show what things will actually be like 
in the twenty thirties 
as professor Taylor was saying 
they 're firmly rooted 
in the literature reviews which covered all the areas he was talking about 
they 're not things which are simply plucked out of thin air 
erm the literature reviews 
are giving us pointers 
to possible strategies for improvement and also possible pitfalls 
now 
I I I suspect 
not everybody will have had a chance to 
read the scenarios so I will actually go over them a bit but for those of you who have 
you 'll notice 
that there are no references 
to things like the curriculum for excellence or Highers or A levels anything like that 
and this is quite deliberate 
erm because the scenarios are intended to provoke discussion 
across the whole of the UK 
and they provide an endpoint 
which everyone 
will approach from their particular perspective 
and of course 
erm if we 're looking to twenty thirty 
who knows what the configuration of the UK will be like by that time 
erm 
but 
when it comes to this presentation 
because everybody here 
has their own perspective 
I may suggest a few issues to consider but I 'll largely be talking through the key points of the scenarios 
so that you 
can pick up 
on what you want to from this 
because you will all have particular areas that you 're interested in 
so what it is we have two scenarios 
they 're focusing on STEM education 
and they 're set 
around twenty years in the future 
they both feature young women 
and this is because fewer girls than boys 
continue with STEM subjects 
one scenario focuses on Bashabee 
who 's 
thirty 
so she 
right now 
is in her early teens 
the second centres on Lily 
who 's just being born 
around now 
and 
she 's seventeen 
at the time the scenario takes place 
I said earlier that the unpredictability of the future was itself relevant 
we do n't know yet 
what sorts of jobs there will be 
but we know that they 're likely to be very different from now 
and the scenarios actually draw on informed speculation about that 
Beshabee 
who 's our thirt- 
thirty year-old she 's already in the world of work 
but she graduated in chemical engineering 
and she is now working 
for a multinational 
as 
a matter programmer 
this means that she uses computer-based tools to design new materials at the submolecular level 
and she collaborates with designers 
material scientists and synthetic biologists 
quite different from things that we have at the moment 
Lily 
our seventeen year-old 
she 's artistic 
and she is also interested in neuroscience 
so what she 's considering right now 
is becoming a cognitive ecologist 
these are specialists who design environments which enhance creativity 
and they take account of the brain they take account of the body and they take account of the world around us 
so what does this mean does this mean that our current silos of physics chemistry and biology are not going to be fit for purpose 
research today already shows that pupils do better in science when it 's integrated with maths 
and also shows that the split between science and technology 
actually means that pupils think technology is interesting 
but science is n't 
in the world of the scenarios 
STEM 
by that time is considered a misnomer 
it could properly be called 
GRAIN 
genomics 
robotics artifical intelligence and nanotechnology 
and the integration does n't actually stop there because it 's not STEM it 's STEAM 
it includes arts in that we 've got integration 
this means a commitment 
to a broad-based education system which allows pupils to keep their options open 
but those are options 
in the world of the scenarios 
STEM is only compulsory 
until age fifteen 
although there are a lot of people who think that it should be compulsory until eighteen 
one teacher says in scenari- in the scenarios that he wants 
volunteers not conscripts 
and that 's something to think about as well 
now according to the literature reviews this again 
is 
exactly what professor Taylor was talking about 
countries that are seen as successful in STEM 
share 
a number of common features 
and these include teaching being perceived 
as a high status profession 
and also STEM teachers being fully trained in their main subject and only teaching this subject 
so in the world of the scenarios 
teaching has been established as a Masters-level profession 
this actually follows the successful example of Finland 
and since teaching is well-paid 
and attractive 
there are many more applicants than there are places 
so this allows for careful selection of future teachers 
teachers are licensed to teach particular age ranges 
and specific subjects 
and this includes primary teachers 
with STEM specialisms 
early years 
and primary education 
in the twenty thirties are seen as absolutely crucial 
the literature reviews show that at present 
most pupils have decided by the age of eleven or twelve 
that they 're not going to go for science 
Bashabee 
our thirteen year-ol- our thirty year-old 
and Lily our seventeen year-old 
have had very different experiences of schooling 
when Bashabee was fourteen 
so that 's around the present day 
her chemistry teacher encouraged her to join an after-school club 
coordinated by STEMNET 
and that led her to go to a free university summer school where she first encountered chemical engineering 
like all school girls 
she had a female mentor 
who told her 
that she would need good passes in chemistry and maths to get on to the degree course 
that was the first time 
she had had any information on a STEM career 
and it was just in time 
since she might otherwise have dropped a subject that she later found that she needed 
but Lily 
our seventeen year-old 
had careers advice starting in primary school 
the scenarios are set 
under a benign regime which has decided to make investment in education its priority 
I have to say I keep thinking back to those stickers that we had in the nineteen nineties that said if you think education is expensive try ignorance and I just 
wish people would think about that a bit more 
erm but even in our future utopia funds are n't limitless 
and targeting early years and primary 
as well as making teaching a Masters-level 
profession 
means that funding for the universities 
has been drastically cut 
and the universities are having to do a lot more to raise their own funds 
so you may want to consider the question of what sector of education funds should be targeted at 
but even this benign government 
is piloting a controversial scheme of increasing class sizes 
in order to underwrite teachers ' new enhanced pay scales 
this follows 
the model which is very successful in South Korea 
the scheme supporters say that technological developments 
including properly accredited and appraised online resources 
make it easier to cope with bigger classes 
and teachers ' pay is an important issue 
because in the interest of making STEM accessible to all 
the best teachers 
are actually paid a premium 
to teach in schools in deprived areas 
but returning to Lily 
how Bashabee did n't really get any careers advice except at the university 's summer school 
Lily 's careers advice actually started 
before she even got to school 
when she was a toddler 
her parents were invited to a presentation by the institute of physics 
where educationalists and STEM professionals explained the job opportunities which would be available to their children 
and the salaries that they might subsequently expect 
you remember that Lily was born around now 
and the institute of physics actually does this 
at the moment 
although obviously not nationwide 
now Lily 's father thought that this was ridiculously premature 
and he was shocked to discover the importance of early brain development 
Lily 's parents were told that attitudes to STEM 
were a strong predictor of how well a child would do 
and that parents and teachers could influence these attitudes 
Lily 's mother 
in common with a lot of parents 
she 's got a maths phobia 
and when she discovered that numeracy was just as important as literacy 
she was really worried that she was going to give Lily negative messages about maths 
but she was encouraged through the national numeracy initiative 
and found out that everyday activities 
from something as simple as pairing up socks 
to actually checking when the bus is due to come 
were practical maths that she could teach her daughter 
national numeracy also showed Lily 's parents how to promote maths through play and they began to appreciate 
how much maths 
is an intrinsic part of the world 
which is something that 
a lot of people 
just it goes over their head they 're scared of it they do n't want to think about it 
now by the time Lily is at school 
maths is promoted as essential for everybody 
including non-scientists 
there 's an emphasis on fluency in maths 
being able to recall basic facts alongside statistics and the application of maths 
and it 's recognised 
that for many pupils 
mathematical fluency is far more important 
than the knowledge of calculus 
although calculus is still there 
for those who need it and who want it 
but it 's not 
the only way 
research has also confirmed that girls perform better 
in STEM subjects in a single-sex cohort 
now Lily attends a co-educational school 
but she 's actually put 
in all-girls classes for a number of subjects 
and this has resulted in fierce competition between the girls and the boys to see which group 
performs better 
so the girls are actually trying to excel in these subjects 
Lily is also facing a very different system of testing and exams from Bashabee 
there have been significant reforms which show recognition 
of teachers ' expertise 
when Bashabee was at school 
i e around now 
a lot of STEM teachers saw their subt- 
subject knowledge as established fact 
that 
can lead to pretty static content 
and there were teaching methods that were really just aimed at imparting knowledge to pupils 
pupils in primary and secondary were confronted by summative assessment 
and were taught from the perspective of passing exams 
what do you need to know to pass the exam 
but by the twenty thirties 
there 's a trusted internal evaluation system from early years until age eighteen 
with teachers pooling their expertise to assess pupils across different schools 
assessment is much more creative 
it 's backed by strong educational research 
and it aims to develop skills which employers value such as problem solving 
it 's not focusing on low-level facts but instead it 's concentrating on understanding and application 
and of course we 've got the benefit of all sorts of new and interesting technologies by then so in fact the pupils 
will wear 
little headsets 
cheap headsets 
which will actually scan their brains 
and the teacher will be able to see 
whether the pupils are absorbing what 's being taught or not and can see who needs to be targeted if they 're not getting it 
now the reason this is allowed to happen 
is that in the world of the scenarios 
there is now an overarching professional 
organisation called the Royal College of Teaching 
analogous to the medical colleges 
and it determines standards and targets for training and engagement 
this Royal College of Teaching 
it was set up in twenty nineteen 
so 
not very far away 
it provides the kitemark for educational resources 
and it oversees an official research programme into curriculum assessment 
and of course now that teaching is a Masters-level profession 
this 
in itself is producing ongoing research 
teacher education includes the importance 
of the public communication of science 
there 's increasing understanding of how to communicate effectively 
thanks to the research that 's being created by the master 's courses 
and again as professor Taylor was mentioning 
a concomitant of the master 's degree is CPD 
this is particularly crucial for STEM 
given the pace of change 
there has to be 
life-long professional development 
it ca n't be 
an education once and for all 
and in the world of our scenarios 
the blurring of the line between STEM disciplines 
is helped 
by greater collaboration between teachers and lecturers 
teachers now take it as a given 
that they 're going to work collaboratively 
both within and between schools 
with lecturers from further education colleges 
and with mentors from industry and the professions 
this helps the teachers to keep up to date with their subjects 
and it also opens the pupils ' minds to real world challenges 
and post-school opportunities 
in this world 
vocational education is very highly prized 
it 's not a second best 
so there are very close links between schools 
colleges and industry 
Lily in fact our seventeen year-old goes to classes both 
in school 
and at the local college 
now I have to apologise in advance for what I 'm about to say 
please do n't shoot the messenger I 'm only repeating what emerged from the literature reviews 
what they said was 
those with a background in science and mathematics tend to be 
less adept at the people 's skills which underpin collaborative and inclusive styles of working 
then went on to say that physics and maths students were frequently attached to their subject by love of 
impersonal patterns 
which make them 
less suited to working in a classroom 
than arts and social science students who actually had an interest in people 
they also said that women tended to be more people-oriented than men 
which made female STEM students more likely to go into teaching 
but in the world of the scenarios 
increased collaboration between teachers and other STEM specialists 
means 
it does n't have to be all or nothing 
even male physicists 
could be prepared to have the occasional foray 
into teaching 
working with teachers 
rather than having to sign up to be the teacher themselves 
and 
I mean we are talking about male physicists here so if they really ca n't cope with meeting other people 
they can even do it 
through virtual learning interfaces they do n't even have to stand up in front of pupils 
now Bashabee 
our thirty year-old is conscious that she opted for STEM because of the female mentor 
that she met at the university summer school 
so she has become 
an industrial mentor 
to help inspire and excite the pupils 
and to bring the latest developments into the classroom 
several teachers have shadowed her in the lab 
as part of their CPD 
and she also enjoys discussing with them how her work could be presented 
to various age groups 
now I 'm conscious of the time 
and 
these scenarios are basically a starting point to provoke discussion about how we want to move forward 
so I think I 'll put the time machine reverse 
get us back to twenty thirteen 
and you can take it forward from here 
thank you very much
