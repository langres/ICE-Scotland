we live in a society which relies on a quick flow of information and we live in a time when analysis and opinion of the latest developments are consumed by an awakening general public that awakening is down in large part to the Referendum Debate through which there was widespread discussion not just of the constitutional question but of wider social issues and indeed the media coverage of this historic event there is a changing relationship between the people of Scotland and power the democratic revival we're experiencing is marked by the search and interest in politics that means where we get our news and indeed in whose interest interests the media is run is of renewed importance and must be under intensified scrutiny Presiding Officer on the twenty ninth of April the Scottish government erm rightly so had a debate on TTIP the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and in my short experience in this place I have not seen the erm packed the the Public Gallery packed as it was and I think I would be right in saying that the issue was raised through social media that brought the public's attention to an item of real interest and real concern and if social media can do that then let's have more of that Presiding Officer we have to discuss ways in which we can support journalism in Scotland local newspapers provide an often invaluable service and certainly in the Highlands and Islands we have a healthy distribution of local press and the new wave of citizen-led coverage and comment is an important development that must be registered and I'm pleased to note and I didn't know this until recently that this is actually Local Newspaper Week we need to think in an interconnected way about investment into journalism and print media or recognising the surge in social and new media but we must take this debate much further we need to apply scrutiny to the way particular media institutions have covered recent social and political affairs for example we might question and expose the myth mongering pushed by broad sections of the press on the question of immigration we might also note the widespre- widespread problem the BBC now has in Scotland where in recent years staff cuts and reduced resources have had a negative impact on the service that we need and want we changed to the BBC Charter make it possible for responsibility to rest with Holyrood instead of Westminster that of course should also be the subject of a debate in many profound ways we live in a media managed democracy we know the hold that a tiny minority of media owners can have over the outcome and framing of political events in the public mind for so long this has been impenetrable but as democrats who have a view on the need for balanced and critical debate perhaps now more than ever we have a chance to challenge the vested interests and corporate power that lies behind sections of the mass media now more than ever we have an electorate who have begun the process of grappling with this question people are becoming shrewder about what information they digest with many using the internet to do their own more considered research into the issues of the day domestic and international Presiding Officer as elected representatives of the people we have a particular responsibility to uphold when it comes to how our actions are covered but more than that we have a duty to ensure that coverage of the big debates currently polarising society is not left to the media barons it is time is it not for a new look at our media a proper assessment of new media and a willingness to explore how we can support journalism as a trade and hugely important profession in Scotland at a time when we see a resurgence in people sensing the power of their opinion and their vote it is crucial that we express our desire to support those who can articulate and record their considered opinion for the benefit of increasing our knowledge and challenging how we think this debate could not be happening at a more important moment in the development of our democracy and our society as a whole Presiding Officer I think it's time for even bigger debate to happen in Scotland as to how we discover as we discover more about our country as we learn more about each other as we learn more and more about the possibilities and raise a- th- the ability f- for us to take erm action and raise our game I think that this debate is relevant today and I thank you for the erm ability to be able to voice my concern thank you
