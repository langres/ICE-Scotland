well good afternoon everyone my name's Elaine Smith and as Deputy Presiding Officer I'm delighted to welcome you here erm to the Scottish Parliament and the eighth annual Saint Andrew's Day debate today's debate and of course the wider competition that preceded it erm have been organised in partnership with Education Scotland and the English-speaking union sorry could you all take a seat apologies I usually sit down  when everyone sits down erm I want to start by expressing my thanks to everyone involved from both of those organisations for their hard work and efforts which culminate in today's event today you're in the debating chamber that usually serves as the place where our devolved legislation is enacted and it can be a challenge at times I have to say presiding over the proceedings in this chamber sometimes the debates are passionate sometimes they're controversial and sometimes consensus even breaks out with all sides agreeing that a piece of legislation is too important for erm party political division whatever the debate the parliamentarians are professionals and so the bar is set high here in our seat of government so there's a high standard set but I've always been very impressed with the extremely high standard of debating demonstrated by the finalists in this competition and who knows maybe we have some future MSPs and ministers here amongst you today in fact only last week during a debate in this chamber Jackie Baillie recalled a visitor school where she met a schoolboy who is now the newly appointed minister for local government and community empowerment Marco Biaggi MSP and in the same debate the First Minister spoke of another government minister Humza Yousaf MSP who recalled that the first time he met her was when she visited his modern studies class so I've got high hopes for some of you who're here today the unique style that this St Andrew's day debate offers and its pairing of students from our schools and universities is clearly a successful formula since the contest continues to go from strength to strength and I was reliably informed just before starting that this year is in fact the best ever the Scottish Parliament is always pleased to host this competition as it not only affords the opportunity for students and pupils to debate in the chamber but it also provides us with an appropriate way of marking Saint Andrew's Day patron saints are a tradition which comes from Orthodox and Christian churches and saints often become the patrons of places where they were born or had been active or where relics remain and Saint Andrew's relics are in Saint Mary's cathedral here in Edinburgh and this also provides Scotland with a special link to Amalfi in Italy and Patras in Greece where two cathedrals named after the saint also hold his relics there are many Saint Andrew's Days societies worldwide and these were set up originally as self-help organisations for Scots who'd fallen on hard times and they now form a network of Scots who are all united under the saltire cross of Saint Andrew and they give Scotland a European and worldwide dimension and they include societies in places such as Bermuda and Washington D C and closer to home more and more of our Scottish towns and cities are using Saint Andrew's day as a platform to launch winter festivals and celebrations to get us all through the cold drich winter months and today of course as we look outside we can see the cold and drich weather has started already however in here it's a lot brighter as the chamber floor has been given over to some of Scotland's most talented young debators I wish our finalists the very best of luck and also good luck to everyone who will be taking part in the open debate which I'll come to a bit later and finally I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to everyone in the galleries friends classmates teachers and family and to those watching live on Glow TV in classrooms round the country I hope you enjoy this afternoon's debate and I hope you enjoy your visit to your Scottish Parliament thank you very much
