good afternoon Mister Chair 
ladies gentlemen and my fellow debaters 
we are here today to discuss the pressing question that the Scottish people will be asked on the eighteenth of September 
and Portree High School students will be asked later today 
should Scotland be an independent country 
my name is Jessica Jackson and as my 
and my team as our campaign name suggests believe that yes 
Scotland should become an independent country 
we intend to show you the true benefits of 
independence by discussing 
the benefits of an independent Scottish agriculture 
and fisheries 
why devolution does not work for the people of Scotland 
Scotland 's natural resources renewable energy 
oil 
and why Scotland 's economy will prosper as an independent country 
I 'll begin by talking to you about how Scottish independence will enhance Scottish agriculture and fishing 
the EU agricultural plan is working towards convergence 
whereby all farmers ' subsidy payments 
in the EU 
are moving towards a single rate per hectar 
Scotland was so far below the average European payment an additional two hundred and twenty three million Euros 
was allocated to the UK subsidy budget 
to uplift Scotland 
Scottish payments closer to the average a hundred and ninety eight Euros 
Westminster then took this money and divided it between the whole UK 
as a result Scottish farmers are now on average receiving the lowest rates per hectar 
in the whole of Europe 
many farmers and crofters including around Skye and Lochalsh 
are disadvantaged because of Westminster 's decision 
an 
in some areas our farmers will rec- 
be receiving as little as ten Euros per hectar 
not a hundred and ninety eight 
ten 
because of Westminster 
it 's not just agriculture that would benefit from an independent Scotland 
fishing is 
in Scotland comprises 
a significant proportion of the UK fishing industry 
Scotland has just eight point four percent of the UK population 
but lands over sixty percent of the UK catch in its ports 
the UK government does not negotiate on Scotland 's behalf effectively 
we only receive one point one percent of European fisheries funding 
despite accounting for 
more than twelve percent of the EU agricultural production 
it 's a similar scenario to the agricultural system 
whereby the UK government controls the important things 
like overall budget and European negotiations 
it 's a bit like a puppet show 
it looks like Scotland is in control 
but Westminster is the puppeteer pulling the strings and dictating the way the show will go 
under independence a fully Scottish-controlled fishing and agricultural industry would flourish economically 
the choice for you is simple 
either we want to remain puppets in the UK where it appears we 're able to determine our own future 
but in reality we 're being controlled by playmasters in Westminster 
who do not act in our best interests 
or 
we can cut the strings 
and take control over our own country 's destiny 
by voting yes 
it is certainly clear that both the agricultural and fishing industries 
would be better off leaving the Westminster theatre 
I 'm sure you will agree and make the right choice 
yes 
Scotland should become an independent country
