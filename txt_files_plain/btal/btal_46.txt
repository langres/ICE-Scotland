during the First World War 
the Scottish Women 's Hospital Units 
worked to save the lives of sick 
and wounded soldiers and civilians 
in war zones across Europe 
the driving force behind this organisation 
was Doctor Elsie Inglis from Edinburgh 
one of the first women to become a doctor in the eighteen eighties 
she overcame prejudice and challenges in order to qualify 
in the eighteen nineties 
Doctor Inglis became involved with the women 's suffrage movement 
to try to improve the lives of working-class women across the country 
by August nineteen fourteen 
when war was declared 
she was nearly fifty 
and had already had a significant career in Edinburgh 
as a doctor and surgeon 
specialising in treating women and children 
Doctor Inglis had also been involved in the Voluntary Aid Detachment movement 
which had been set up to train civilians 
to provide service to the war efforts 
Inglis offered her services to the war office 
but was allegedly turned down by an official 
who responded with the words 
my good lady 
go home 
and sit still 
other countries who were in serious need of medical support and nurses 
gladly accepted the offer of help from the Scottish Women 's Hospital Units 
the first unit started work in France at the abbey of Royaumont 
in nineteen fourteen 
and then in Kragujevac in Serbia 
in nineteen fifteen 
a fundraising campaign began 
with support from the National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies 
this was soon extended to include funding 
from other organisations 
individuals 
and communities 
flag days were organised 
and a system to sponsor hospital beds and wards was created 
this meant that several hospital units were able to be set up 
a wide range of staff were needed to run the hospitals 
as well as doctors 
surgeons and nurses 
large numbers of support staff 
including radiographers 
cooks 
administrators 
orderlies 
and ambulance drivers were also needed 
the women travelled from Britain 
along with vehicles equipment and supplies 
and set up the hospitals from scratch 
at Royaumont 
under the guidance of Chief Medical Officer Doctor Frances Ivens 
staff cleared out the disused abbey building 
scrubbed it clean 
and then set up wards 
an operating theatre 
an X-ray room 
and dispensary 
many of the hospitals had to deal with the arrival of large numbers of wounded soldiers all at once 
they treated soldiers who had been gassed 
and those caught in heavy shelling with shrapnel injuries 
some patients were suffering from gangrene 
frostbite 
and advanced infections 
over fifteen hundred women signed up to work in the Scottish Women 's Hospitals 
they were from a variety of different backgrounds 
some were from affluent society families 
others from crofting communities 
as well as trained professional nurses 
some recruits came from other countries 
including France 
and Australia 
many of the women volunteers had a strong sense of adventure 
and were attracted to the opportunity to travel and work in other countries 
away from the strict customs and traditions 
that limited how women could live 
in Edwardian Britain 
the hospitals were however well-organised and disciplined units 
and although some women did struggle with the rules 
many lifelong friendships were formed between the staff and local communities 
this was particularly the case in Serbia 
where many of the hospitals were based 
and strong bonds were formed between the local people 
and the women working in the hospitals 
many of the staff received military and national bravery decorations and commendations from foreign governments 
in the countries in which they served 
including awards for treating the wounded while under fire 
after the war 
some of the staff returned to the countries in which they had been stationed 
and worked to rebuild communities 
nurse training schools were set up in Serbia 
and children 's homes were also established 
countries who had benefited from their service continued to celebrate the work 
of the Scottish Women 's Hospital Units 
and the women who worked to save the lives 
of both soldiers 
and civilians 
anniversary events are held annually in Serbia 
to remember those who died in service 
Doctor Elsie Inglis died in November nineteen seventeen in Newcastle 
shortly after returning from her last hospital trip in Russia 
she had been ill for some time 
but managed to hide this from colleagues 
her death was widely covered in the UK press 
and her funeral was at Saint Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh 
attended by royalty 
and dignitaries 
from the countries in which she served
