thank you it 's a pleasure to be here 
a man hurries into the storage area of the town 's food bank 
he 's recognised as someone who had food delivered to his house 
just a few weeks ago 
on their guard they 're 
about to quiz him 
but he smiles and signals to the van outside 
his wife and 
four children 
emerge 
carrying 
half a dozen carrier bags 
you helped me 
when I was at my wit 's end 
now I am back on my feet 
please 
help some others 
that is one of a number of stories I could have shared with you from the various visits I 've made 
both home and abroad 
my theme for the year has been hope 
and part of my journey has been to visit places where there is 
hopelessness 
and despair 
in Romania 
in Greece 
and I 'm ashamed to say 
in Scotland 
people caught in a spiral that 
ultimately leads to debt 
and retreat to modern-day money lenders 
many people we met 
were honest 
desperate 
to be hard working 
but so many epitomised 
hopelessness 
yet even in that hopelessness 
we witnessed hope 
hope that was evident through so many ordinary people 
who saw their witness 
of the Christian faith 
as faith issuing in action 
I 'm 
privileged 
to represent 
the largest denomination the Church of Scotland 
but more than that I am part of a faith 
that follows one who said when you do it to the least 
you do it to me 
the Old Testament concept of justice was mishpat 
which is not simply the good are rewarded and the bad are punished 
but rather a society that cares for the vulnerable those 
who are fragile 
you are 
in politics 
because you want to see a society 
that is just 
and fair 
the end goals I hope 
are the same 
but 
we may differ 
from our different perspectives 
and even political standpoints as to how we achieve that 
we seek 
to work with you 
and we need 
to work 
in partnership 
we are present in 
every part of Scotland 
in the various situations and problems 
of every area of life working independently 
and alongside other faith communities 
to seek the best 
for all our people 
that is why 
we call ourselves 
a national church 
and regardless of the outcome 
in September two thousand and fourteen 
we 
will continue 
in every part of Scotland to play our part 
and to work with you 
we see it 
as serving 
our Lord 
and Master 
no more 
and no less 
may God bless you all
