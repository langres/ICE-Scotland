members of the Scottish Parliament 
I 'd like to tell you a story 
about a wee boy 
from a land 
far far away 
it was a wonderful land 
made rich 
by the 
many different cultures and practices which had developed there over its ancient history 
this wee boy though 
was born into one particular clan 
this clan was marred by division and differences 
so much so that they largely kept to themselves 
and even the children of that clan only played with other children of the same clan 
this wee boy loved his clan 
but eventually he decided to go into the world and explore 
and he was astounded to find 
there was people of different clans 
and some people had no clan at all 
they believed different things and they believed them 
with just the same passion 
that his did 
even stranger 
he met some people who said they did n't belong to any clan at all 
they also spoke in a strange language 
there was a phrase they used that stuck in his mind 
for a' that 
an' a' that 
it 's coming yet for a' that 
they said 
that Man to Man 
over the world 
shall brothers be for a' that 
the wee boy 
now a young man 
liked the idea a lot 
he saw it could be a way of uniting the clans 
by telling that they were all part of a greater clan 
the clan called humanity 
in which everyone was equal 
men and women 
black and white 
gay and straight 
able and disabled 
he began to tell people about this big idea 
but to his surprise 
some people were n't interested 
they said that the old ways were the best 
and anyway 
the man who 'd written that poem they cared so much about 
was a scoundrel and a rogue 
and they were never gonna be told to behave by the likes of him 
the young man was frustrated 
but he decided that when he 'd grow up 
he 'd do everything in his power 
to make sure that the children of his land grow up 
to look for things that made them similar to each other and not different 
to 
to wonder 
and to challenge and to question things for themselves 
and to wonder what the words 
fairness 
equality 
and democracy really mean 
what they mean to me 
is secularism 
they guarantee that everybody 
will be treated fairly and equally 
whatever they believe 
as only the fourth humanist to address this parliament 
and as part of an organisation that works to promote secularism in Scotland 
and erm tha- that reflects the views of millions of Scots 
who value 
fairness 
equality 
and democracy 
I leave you with those questions 
and thank you for listening
