Presiding Officer members of the Scottish parliament thank you for the opportunity to address you this afternoon imagine you go home tonight and someone in your family a son daughter partner or sister tells you that they are addicted to drugs and you then find that society either blames you for the addiction or fails to understand what it means for a family to be in recovery this is the reality for many of the families in Scotland impacted by a loved one's substance misuse current estimates say that there are about sixty thousand problematic drug users and some two hundred thousand problem drinkers in Scotland around each person with an addiction there is a constellation of anywhere between four and six people directly impacted Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs is tasked with delivering the drug and alcohol strategies we have a national helpline and from callers to the helpline and the many families we engage with through a network of peer-led family support groups we hear daily what the reality is for everyone affected we hear from seventy eight year old parents struggling to cope with the fifty five year old son's drug addiction  we hear from parents worried about their teenage son's use of new psychoactive substances of legal highs and we hear about cousins worried that their relative has once more relapsed and is suicidal numerous national and international studies show that the harms experienced by families as a result of the relative's drug m- misuse includes psychological distress mental and physical health ill health domestic abuse and negative financial consequences this also can lead to social isolation stigma unfortunately still surrounds anyone with an addiction and for those close to someone with an addiction there's a double stigma so often being shunned just for loving a son or a father or a daughter who is misusing substances one family member told me that it was easier dealing with her son's addiction than being ignored or pointed at in the street by neighbours and former friends what do families need they're in need of services in their own right they need understanding and support to help them as they hold their families together again on our helpline when asked what they would like the average family member simply says help for my boy or I just want her to get her life back together families are very selfless people and what would our communities be without them I would like to leave you with the following thought how children outgrow childhood parents never outgrow parenthood thank you
