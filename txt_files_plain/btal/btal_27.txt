I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss palliative and end-of-life care 
and I particularly welcome Marie Curie 's latest report 
on changing the conversation on terminal illness 
together with the important research on access to palliative care 
carried out on behalf of the charity 
by the London School of Economics 
I 'm also grateful to colleagues across the political divide 
who 've enabled this debate to take place 
to find us the active holistic care of people with advanced progressive illness 
involving the management of pain and other symptoms 
and the provision 
of psychological social and spiritual support 
clearly 
palliative care 
would be a benefit to very many people 
as they approach the end of their lives 
not just to those with terminal cancer 
which is the condition most commonly diagnosed 
in those who actually receive this form of care 
but many people in the UK today 
who would derive benefit from palliative care 
are either not offered it 
or receive it 
for only a very short time before they die 
the common fa- facts are stark 
and clearly indicate why positive action needs to be taken 
to support people living with a terminal illness and their families 
if they 're to be sure of getting the care they need 
as their condition progresses 
of the fifty four thousand people who die in Scotland each year 
it 's estimated that between thirty five and forty thousand 
should have some palliative care 
but the LSE study from Marie Curie 
found that nearly eleven thousand who need it 
are not in fact receiving it 
and only one in five people with a non-cancer diagnosis 
are identified for palliative care 
with carers across the UK 
claiming that seven out of every ten people with a terminal illness 
do not get all the care and support they need 
and even a quarter of cancer patients 
are not receiving palliative care 
specific groups of people less likely to be considered for palliative care 
are those aged over eighty five 
those who live alone 
those from black 
Asian and minority ethnic communities 
and those who live in areas of deprivation 
this is simply not good enough 
and indicates significant in- 
inequity of provision today 
a problem which will undoubtedly get worse 
as our population ages 
and less action is taken urgently 
to address the situation 
at present a third of the patients in Scottish hospitals 
are in their last year of life 
and half of Scotland 's deaths 
occur in hospital 
even though most people 's preference is to die at home or in a homely setting 
so we 're already well short of providing the end-of-life care which most people seek 
and given the predicted thirteen percent increase in deaths over the next twenty five years 
and the fact that many of us who live well into advanced old age 
will have multiple and complex health problems 
such as dementia heart failure 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
or the complications of diabetes or long-term obesity 
there is a clear and urgent need 
for the conversation about terminal care 
which is being recommended by Marie Curie 
we should acknowledge 
that people with all types of terminal disease 
and not just cancer 
can benefit from palliative care 
and this ideally 
should be planned for 
from the point of diagnosis of the terminal nature of the illness 
so that an appropriate care pathway 's in place as the condition progresses 
and this care can be delivered within the community 
in a hospice 
or when necessary in hospital 
a significant amount of work remains to be done 
if we are to do 
as- 
achieve a gold standard of palliative care 
for the maximum number of patients who require it 
there has to be a conversation between policy-makers 
health and social care professionals 
service planners and communities 
about what sort of care and support we want to give to people 
with terminal illness 
when their needs are becoming more complex 
are often not being 
met 
and are likely to grow in number 
at the outset 
health and social care professionals should be prepared to speak openly 
and honestly to patients 
and their families and carers 
about the terminal nature of their illness 
and help them to plan their care pathway 
letting them know what services will be available to them 
and enabling them to make decisions 
which will help them 
as their condition progresses 
many health professionals and many families 
are uncomfortable about having conversations which acknowledge the death for their patient or relative 
is inevitable sooner rather than later 
also depending on the condition and treatment 
terminal ill people 
may live for days weeks months or even years 
after the diagnosis is made 
we need to try to change the culture in Scotland today 
and encourage more open discussion about death 
people seem happy enough to make a will 
and there 's a growing discussion about organ donation 
but there 's still a barrier 
about acknowledging impending death 
professionals need to be given training and support 
to ensure that they 're able to give high-quality person-focused care 
to people 
with terminal illness 
and better links need to be developed 
between generalists and specialists like 
cardiologists neurologists and those who specialise in palliative care 
and as integrated health and social care develops 
the new integrated wards 
should be looking to have palliative care at the heart of their strategic plans 
because ineffective coordination of care between services 
such as health and social care 
or general 
and out-of-hours practice 
and between different organisations can lead to unnecessary delays 
in care and support 
despite shortcomings in getting access to it 
palliative care in Scotland is recognised as being at a high standard 
but we do need to make more progress in achieving equitable access 
to good quality terminal care for all patients who require it 
and Marie Curie have several suggestions for government 
which I will quote and which they think will move things forward 
firstly 
that a reference to terminal illness dying and death 
should be included in its planned revision of the twenty twenty Vision document for Scotland 
also that palliative care 
should be an early priority for integration as I 've just described 
and that in a new strategic framework for action 
on palliative and end-of-life care 
due to be published later on this year 
there should be a clear commitment 
to ensure that everyone with a palliative care need 
has access to it by twenty twenty 
that robust data is collected 
to measure progress 
and the experience of patients and their families 
that training and support is given 
to health and social care professionals to deliver effective care for people who are terminally ill 
and that a clear resource commitment is made 
to achieve the aims and objectives of the strategy 
Presiding Officer 
we live at a time when more and more people are living into healthy and active old age 
thanks largely to modern developments in medical techniques and pharmaceutical products 
but all of us are mortal 
and sooner or later many of us will require palliative and end-of-life care 
some earlier in life following congenital or degenerative 
neurological or other conditions 
or malignancy 
others much later 
from diseases I already referred to 
and I would like to think that we can in the foreseeable future 
achieve a high standard of such care 
for everyone who needs it 
whatever their personal circumstances 
and wherever they live in Scotland 
not only is this desirable 
it should also be cost-effective 
with The Nuffield Trust estimating 
potential savings of five hundred pounds per person 
by enabling people at the end of life 
to be cared for at home or in the community 
community 
Presiding Officer I look forward to the debate 
and to the Minister 's response 
and I hope 
everyone agrees 
that high-quality accessible palliative care 
is what we would all wish to achieve 
and what we should be striving for 
thank you
