New build homes scheme aims to welcome wildlife with bird boxes 

New homes idea is one for the birds . 
Potential new home owners are offered plenty of incentives to purchase a new build these days . 
The latest , from Miller Homes , is a little unusual . The housebuilder is encouraging new buyers to welcome wildlife into their gardens through a partnership with RSPB . 
Buyers of the developments at Winchburgh 's Glendevon Gate , near Edinburgh , and New Stevenston , Lanarkshire 's Fullwood Gardens , will receive a nest box . 
They will also be given tips on how to encourage biodiversity by making their gardens a place where birds and other creatures can thrive . 
According to the RSPB , wildlife and natural places are under a great deal of pressure and are in danger of being lost . 
Duncan Orr-Ewing , who is responsible for the RSPB 's species and land management , said : " Homes are where we eat , sleep and bring up our families . 
" Wildlife has the same basic needs and we are pleased Miller Homes is taking steps to promote gardens as a place to protect nature and to allow it to thrive . 
" We hope the nest boxes will prove to be an exciting addition for the Miller Homes ' purchasers involved in this initiative . We 're confident that when families put theirs to use they 'll be amazed at what they find . " 
Anne Marie Britton from Miller Homes Scotland said : " One of the very simple steps we can take is to encourage biodiversity in the communities we are creating . 
" We hope the families moving into our homes will enjoy using the nest box to give nature a home in their gardens . "
