Scotland’s new tax agency gears up for April 
    start

SCOTLAND’S new tax agency is ready to “hit the ground 
    running” as it prepares to administer the first devolved taxes for 
    more than 300 years, according to the Deputy First 
    Minister.
Revenue Scotland has been set up to collect the land and 
    buildings transaction tax, which replaces the current stamp duty, 
    and the Scottish landfill tax from April 1.
John Swinney has now written to the UK Government asking for the 
    necessary legislation to be laid at Westminster to “switch off” the 
    two UK taxes in Scotland - stamp duty land tax and UK landfill tax 
    - from April 1.
He said: “Revenue Scotland staff have been working 
    extremely hard to implement our long-standing plans to be ready to 
    hit the ground running on April 1, to collect and manage the two 
    devolved taxes.
“A group of senior Scottish and UK government officials 
    have agreed that all necessary preparations are now in place and 
    arrangements can now be made to introduce the devolved 
    taxes.”
