Taxi fare increase halted after council blunder 

TAXI fares in the region will not increase after the deputy traffic commissioner found Highland Council had failed to consult properly with the taxi trade . 
Richard McFarlane has decided not to confirm the council 's proposed taxi fare scale increases . 
The council wanted to increase the fee by 30 pence , regardless of distance travelled , when passengers are first picked up in what is called the " flag fall " – the initial amount on the meter . It would have taken the amount up to £ 2.50 , £ 3 and £ 3.60 for weekdays , nights and weekends and festive holidays , respectively . 
The cost of outward journeys for hires starting three miles or more away from the taxi or its home base – whichever is the nearest – was also set to increase from £ 6.50 to a maximum of £ 7.50 . 
Dozens of taxi drivers objected to the proposed price increase and called for remote areas to be licensed separately from operators in the city . They said they were struggling to attract passengers and warned the fare hike was not in their interest . 
The proposed increase was due to come into effect in May but was appealed and a public hearing took place in July . Mr McFarlane confirmed his findings today . 
" I determine that Highland Council has not fully discharged their obligations in terms of Section 17 of the Act , " said Mr McFarlane . " The required consultation did not take place . The focus has undoubtedly been on the Inverness operators . Whilst I understand that the tariff one journeys are not dissimilar in Inverness and Lochaber I do not believe the committee had sufficient information before it to properly review the scales for all the different rural communities in its area . " 
It means the scale will stay at that implemented in January 2013 .
