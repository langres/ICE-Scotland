Major military exercise heads north 

The North of Scotland is set to host elements of a major military exercise on October 7 when Exercise Joint Warrior 142 begins . 
The multinational exercise , which is held twice a year in the spring and autumn , will involve 22 naval units and around 52 fixed wing aircraft . 
Countries taking part in the maritime part of Joint Warrior are the UK , the United States , the Netherlands , France , Denmark , Norway , Spain , Germany , Lithuania , Belgium , Poland , Estonia and Latvia , with the US Navy 's Commander Destroyer Squadron 26 assuming overall command of the task group . 
Meanwhile , RAF Lossiemouth in Moray will operate both Typhoon and Tornado GR4 aircraft and host fighter planes from Sweden , Belgium and Germany . 
Exercise Joint Warrior provides all three UK Armed Services , and invited allied nations , with the opportunity to hone the vital skills needed to fight and win on today 's battlefield . 
Joint Warrior will simulate a broad range of realistic scenarios encountered in modern day conflicts and peace keeping missions . Military skills practiced will include : anti-submarine warfare ; anti-surface warfare ; mine countermeasures ; live firing ; counter-smuggling and counter-insurgency ; electronic warfare ; and logistics support . 
Over the two-week period , the exercise will develop from an initial period of military and political tensions into simulated war fighting and potentially state on state hostilities . Key to Joint Warrior is the opportunity to practice and improve the tactics , techniques and procedures required of the Armed Forces . 
Coordinating events will be around 150 additional military personnel , many of them Reservists , who will operate from HM Naval Base Clyde during the fortnight .
