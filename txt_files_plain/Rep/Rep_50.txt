High-flying course helps cure flight phobia
 
A woman’s fear of flying quadrupled the cost of her 
    holiday.
The 32-year-old had a fear of flying but had just about managed 
    to conquer it enough to get on a flight to Tunisia recently. She 
    was given medication to help but still suffered a mid-air panic 
    attack.
When the week-long break came to an end she was so terrified she 
    couldn’t make the flight and she and her fiance ended up spending a 
    further month in Tunisia.
By the time £100-a-night hotel bills, overland and ferry bills 
    and the travel costs of her mum who flew out to try to help were 
    paid, £5,000 had been added to the original £1,600 cost.
She’s far from the only one for whom happy holidays become 
    anything but as a result of flying fear.
British Airways reckon that about a quarter of people have some 
    degree of a fear of flying while one in 10 suffer from a real 
    phobia.
They are one of the major carriers who run courses to help 
    nervous flyers take to the skies.
More than 45,000 have booked a Flying With Confidence course 
    over the past 20 years and they claim a 98% success rate.
The day-long course, which costs £195, covers a range of 
    relaxation techniques and exercises to help you get airborne.
It culminates in a flight with the next Scots date being held on 
    September 27.
EasyJet are another airline offering courses with one being held 
    at Edinburgh Airport on November 2. Virgin also have a similar 
    offering.
Experts say there are a number of things those with anxieties 
    can do to make the prospect of getting airborne less stressful.
Learning a bit about flying in general and the plane in 
    particular can alleviate irrational fears. And one of the most 
    important tips is to manage your breathing, taking long, deep 
    breaths to help keep you calm.
