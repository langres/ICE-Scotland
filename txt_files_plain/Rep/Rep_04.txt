Identity project to include areas in Glasgow 
THE UK 's largest research project on ethnicity and identity in the UK will include studies into two of Glasgow 's most prominent multi-cultural areas as well as Scotland 's " Irish Catholic question " . 
The Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity ( CoDE ) , jointly based at Glasgow and Manchester universities , is launched this week , with 13 reports by world renowned academics covering issues such as where minorities live , which languages they speak , how healthy they are and how British they feel . 
Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council over the next four years , the first published data will focus on the 2011 Census for England and Wales , with the Scottish findings being made public within three months . 
As well as the census data , the study will focus on how neighbourhoods in London , Manchester , and Cardiff , as well as Pollokshields and Govanhill in Glasgow , have changed since 1945 . 
Andrew Smith , senior lecturer in sociology at Glasgow University said : " The centre will be producing briefings on the Scottish census data from 2011 , exploring questions of national identity and diversity in Scotland , and will support new research studies investigating the Irish Catholic question , the engagement of minority communities with the forthcoming independence referendum , as well as a detailed case-study of the changing dynamics of ethnicity in the Govanhill and Pollokshields . " 
He said one finding in the England Wales Census was that ethnic minority groups were more likely to describe themselves as exclusively British compared with the white British population , who are more likely to see themselves as English .
