Blaze destroys farm building near Inverness 
Written by Stuart Findlay 

A BARN on the eastern outskirts of Inverness has been destroyed in a ferocious fire . 
The blaze , which was reported at 3.11 pm yesterday , happened within a 50 metre by 30 metre barn at Redhill Farm in Alturlie Point . 
Flames could be seen leaping about from the roof of the barn and were visible from the A96 just west of the Balloch junction . 
Two farm workers were treated for smoke inhalation and taken to Raigmore Hospital . Firefighters remain at the scene and are expecting to be there for the rest of today damping down . 
The barn contained around 3500 bales of hay , straw and assorted farm machinery . Three appliances from Inverness were sent to the scene along with a water carrier . 

Group manager John MacDonald said : " The priority for crews was to secure a reliable water supply as it was evident a large amount of water was going to be required to extinguish this fire . 
" Firefighters located a pond nearby and set portable pumps into the water . They were then able to run lines of hose to supply the appliances on the fire ground . 
" Crews used two main jets to tackle the fire . They were assisted by farm personnel who used farm machinery to spread the hay and straw out , making it easier for crews to dampen down the area and target hot spots . 
" The operation continued throughout the night . Firefighters showed great determination and commitment during what was a protracted incident . " 
Sheep and cattle in adjoining fields appeared to be in an agitated state while the flames raged nearby . The farmer declined to speak at the scene .
