Raigmore Hospital ward reopens after flu outbreak

A HOSPITAL ward at Raigmore in Inverness has reopened after 
    being closed for a week because of a flu outbreak.
Ward 7C at the hospital closed on 20th January after seven 
    patients were hit by the bug.
The total later increased to 11 but a spokeswoman for NHS 
    Highland confirmed it was open again after no new cases were 
    reported for five days.
"While the ward has reopened to visitors we would 
    ask members of the public if they, or someone they live with, have 
    been ill with flu or flu like symptoms that they refrain from 
    coming in to the hospital to visit patients," she 
    said.
"Coming in to hospital to visit a family member or 
    friend when you have been ill with symptoms such as those 
    associated with flu could put them, and our other patients, at risk 
    so we would ask that you hold off visiting until you are 
    better."
