Superfast broadband arrives in Forres

Super-fast broadband has today (Wednesday) arrived in Forres.
More than 2,320 homes and businesses in the Moray town now have 
    access to the high-speed technology – and this figure will increase 
    to around 5,450 as Openreach engineers complete the local upgrade 
    in the weeks ahead.
The BT investment was welcomed by Councillor John Cowe, chairman 
    of Moray Council’s economic development and infrastructure services 
    committee, who described it as great news for the town.
Councillor Cowe said: "Super-fast fibre broadband in 
    Forres offers huge benefits to local residents and businesses and 
    will help our local economy to flourish. Better, faster 
    communications help businesses to grow and stimulate job 
    creation.
"The arrival of fibre broadband means local people 
    and firms can do more online at faster speeds and on multiple 
    devices. This is great news for many people in Forres and I look 
    forward to fibre broadband being rolled out across the rest of 
    Moray."
In Scotland, BT is investing around £126 million in fibre 
    broadband partnerships with the Scottish Government, Highlands and 
    Islands Enterprise, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
    (Broadband Delivery UK), European Regional Development Fund and 
    Scotland’s local authorities.
