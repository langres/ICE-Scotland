Aviemore youth goes on trial for alleged sex 
    offence

A youth has gone on trial facing an allegation of sexual assault 
    with intent to rape in Aviemore.
A jury heard evidence today (Monday) from the 19 year-old 
    alleged victim.
She told Inverness Sheriff Court she had been waiting for a lift 
    with a friend in Grampian Road after a night out when they met 20 
    year-old Grant Pringle.
The teenager said she had been sitting on a wall after leaving 
    the Vault nightclub at 3am when she and her friend were joined by 
    Pringle whom she knew from her schooldays.
She said she had been drinking and was tipsy and they went into 
    the garden after her friend’s phone had fallen into the garden.
She said when they went into the garden Pringle touched her 
    bottom and cuddled her from behind.
"I kept pushing him off and said something silly 
    like ‘you little creep’.
She said they started laughing because they thought it was a 
    joke.
The trial was adjourned when jurors experienced difficulty 
    hearing the witness’s evidence which was being broadcast from 
    another room in the court building.
Pringle, of Muirton, Aviemore denies on July 19 within the 
    garden at Laurel Bank, Grampian Road, assaulting the woman by 
    pulling her to the ground, holding her to the ground, attempting to 
    remove her leggings, sexually assaulting her and attempting to rape 
    her.
The trial continues.
