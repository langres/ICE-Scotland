by BRIAN FERGUSON 
AMERICAN comedian Simon Helberg has been handed the prestigious closing night gala slot at the Edinburgh International Film Festival with his directorial debut . 
The star of The Big Bang Theory also has the lead role in We 'll Never Have Paris , a romantic comedy about a man-child unable to propose to his long-term girlfriend . It is said to be largely based on the relationship between Heldberg and his wife Joycelyn Towne , who is also the co-director . 
The film , which also features Star Trek 's Zachary Quinto and Spiderman 2 's Alfred Molina , will get its international premiere at the Festival Theatre on 29 June . 
Festival director Chris Fujiwara said : " With We 'll Never Have Paris , a funny and very personal romantic comedy , we 'll be able to close this year 's festival on a real high note . It 's a film of great charm and considerable intelligence , and Simon Helberg is brilliant in it . " 
Heldberg said : " It is an unbelievable thrill to be picked as the coveted closing night film at such a legendary festival . We hope the people of Scotland will find our pain and suffering as funny as we do . " 
This year 's EIFF , which will run from 18-29 June , will also feature major focuses on German and Iranian cinema . Edinburgh 's regular avant-garde arts night Neu ! Reekie ! will be taking over Summerhall during the festival for a day of German-themed animation and films , accompanied by live music and performance .
