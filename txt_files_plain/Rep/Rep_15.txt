Highland 's under-16s reach last four of Caledonia Youth Cup 

WITH Highland 's senior players enjoying a break it was left to the club 's under-16 squad to take up centre stage and they did this courtesy of a very assured 26-3 victory over Dundee Eagles in the quarter-finals of the Caledonia Youth Cup . 
Highland 's youngsters did not waste any time and got off to a strong start . With the forwards playing a key role , it only took eight minutes for them to help Euan Milton touch down , followed by a Cameron Grant conversion , to go into a 7-0 lead . 
This momentum was maintained , this time the pack setting up George Evans for an unconverted try to move the score on to 12-0 in Highland 's favour . 
This seemed to spark the visitors into action and although they managed a couple of breaks , the home defence was very solid and held them off . 
Near the end of the first half , however , the Eagles did manage to slot over a long range penalty kick to reduce the deficit to nine points at the interval . 
Highland now had the wind at the backs at the restart and this gave the hosts an added advantage that they used to good effect . 
They ran some effective phases that saw them take firm control of the game and this teamwork , along with moving the ball quickly , saw them put Evans through for his second try , converted by Grant , for a 19-3 lead . 
Highland kept control and any threat Dundee posed was easily defended against . It was not long before they added to their tally and again good running and handling allowed Harrison Wright to go over for a try , which was followed by a great conversion out wide by Grant , to complete the scoring . 
This was a very pleasing performance by Highland 's under-16s and will be a timely boost in terms of morale as the squad waits to see who will be their opponents in the semi-final .
