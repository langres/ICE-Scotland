New stats reveal women are ‘bearing the brunt of 
    cuts’

Women are being hit hardest by government welfare cuts according 
    to new House of Commons figures.
Freezing maternity pay is set to cost new mums around £170 
    compared to how much they’d get if the benefit rose in line with 
    inflation.
That follows the Department of Work and Pensions abolishing the 
    health in pregnancy grant worth £190. Women will bear £18 billion 
    of welfare cuts announced for 2015-16 while men will be hit by only 
    around half that.
The SNP, who got the figures from the independent House of 
    Commons Library, claim that Scottish women alone have seen their 
    benefits cut by £4 billion because of the Coalition government’s 
    policies.
SNP MSP Clare Adamson said: “It is appalling that 
    pregnant women and new mothers will all be at least £360 worse off 
    and women are having their benefits disproportionately cut by the 
    Tory Westminster government.
“The fact that women are forced to carry the can for 86% 
    of the cuts is quite simply flabbergasting.
“Last year we saw a 400 per cent increase in the number 
    of people relying on food banks, and now it emerges that pregnant 
    women and new mothers have their entitlements targeted – it’s 
    totally unacceptable.”
