hello and a very good morning to you welcome to Scotland's Talking I'm Ally Bally and also here with me Colin McKay good morning indeed rearing to go two k- two erm guests for us this morning we decided it was better separating them indeed right let's welcome our first guest then Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon good morning good morning how are you this morning it's it's be- been a great Common Ga- Commonwealth Games for the whole of Scotland yeah yeah okay right now it's all about getting our listeners on air with erm a direct access to the Deputy First Minister the number if you'd like to join us is oh eight four five five hundred eleven fifty two oh eight four five five hundred eleven fifty two let's go to the first caller and it's Norman Norman good morning to you good morning you're through to the Deputy First Minister right okay no thank you very much indeed that's erm Norman in Aberdeen let's move up the coast of it Andrew Lamb's in Fraserburgh  Andrew good morning to you thank you very much indeed erm good morning Ally it's all referendum from here on in the Games are over the gloves are off well I do know I think the the if if if you're having a debate between two politicians i- it's not inevitably gonna become a rammy  but i- i- it's much more difficult when you've g- you mea- you've gotta go both sides I think what's better and I think what's better  and I think what's better for folk here trying to make up their mind in the run-up to the referendum is being able to put their questions directly to one side and then the other side and that's what we're gonna be doing over the next six weeks and that takes me to the very first point I've got to ask you this morning De- Deputy First Minister what will the impact of the Games be on the referendum but but will that boost in confidence will the then the the the the kind of swelling of national pride from having a record tally of medals will that have any impact at all do you think because you'd obviously be hoping that it does to to name to name but ten there Norman let's put that to the Deputy First Minister well tell you what tell tell you what Norman let the Deputy First Minister have a go how long would that take Deputy First Minister because you say tha- that Trident might take up to four five years to get rid of and then you've you're gonna take over Faslane and make it that base you can't do everything at the same time there can you can I can I ask ask you ask you just on the back of that Deputy First Minister how long would what Andrew's talking about there in in terms of an independent Scotland erm commissioning erm erm erm crafts from from the  the shipyards how long would would that keep them in business for so how long would that keep them going for so how long would that take well how how how many w- how how many would an independent Scotland want four right but purely on the basis of that independent Scotland's requirement for four how long would that keep them going erm but how long would that keep them going yeah but purely and simply on those four frigates how long would that keep them going it definitely depends when you start it depends how long it takes to build them how long would it take to build four but you're also hearing from Babcock today that if there was an independent Scotland then Faslane for their for their purposes would close good morning Ally I'm very well a wee bit hoarse after cheering on Usain Bolt at Hampden last night but oh it's been fantastic  absolutely wonderful yeah indeed mhm erm ah you know I don't necessarily think there'll be a direct impact on the referendum sport's sport and politics are politics I think the impact on Scotland and certainly the impact on the city of Glasgow will be fantastic in many many ways from the intangible I think we'll have a a real boost in confidence as a result of the fantastic organisation of the Games but also the performance of a wonderful team of athletes through to the more tangible the legacy the infrastructure erm that will be left as a result of these Games so the impact on Scotland and on the city of Glasgow I I think is  and will continue to be fantastic I don't really I'm you know I- I've really enjoyed the Games I think the Games have been outstanding I think people on both sides of the referendum erm campaign and people who are not decided have just had a thoroughly good time watching the Games if you've been in Glasgow savouring and experiencing some of that fantastic atmosphere you know and that is what I want to remember about the Games we'll now go into the final street of the referendum campaigners  no doubt that's what we enter from tomorrow morning onwards and the Yes campaign will be putting forward vigorously and passionately the case for Scotland becoming an independent country so that decisions about the future of our country can be taken by those of us who care most those of us who live in this country and have the biggest stake in making it a success so that we can use the wealth we've got as a country we're one of the richest countries in the world to create a better society that's what it's all about and I look forward to making that argument over the remaining days of the campaign okay okay g- good morning first of all Norman nice to talk to you erm there's a lot of in your question there so let me well I I I I detect I've got a little bit of work still to do to persuade you but I I'm I'm up I'm always I'm always up for a challenge Norman erm let me try and take your question in in different segments y-  you asked about things like passports pensions DVLA if I can describe them as erm embassies absolutely i- if we can describe them as the services are currently provided for Scotland by the UK government erm the reason I can say with confidence that an independent Scotland can afford to provide all these services is that we're the ones that pay for these things already you know these services are not provided free of charge to Scotland by the Westminster government the the cost of these services right now come out of our pockets our taxes our National Insurance contributions what happens now is we send that money to the Treasury in London they decide how much comes back to Scotland with independence our taxes stay in Scotland they get erm collected by a Treasury in Scotland and we decide the priorities for spending that money so yeah I think I would challenge and I think we've all got to challenge this myth that's there's a a magic money tree in London that's sending things free of charge to Scotland all of these services are provided erm and paid for by Scottish tax payers already of course but we don't we're a smaller country so by definition you know we have a a smaller number of people paying taxes but we've also got a smaller number of people to provide those services for I mean one statistic I don't want this debate to become a battle of statistics but one that I think is really important and it shatters this myth that Scotland is somehow subsidised if you look back over the last thirty years I think it's thirty three years to be precise in every single one of these years Scotland has generated more tax per head of population than the UK so you know we pay our way we pay for these services you know being able to provide those services directly gives us more control over the priorities we set for the spending of our taxes you know one of the things it's no secret that I want to see done differently is that instead of erm billions of pounds being spent on nuclear weapons on the Clyde erm I think it would be better for that money to be spent on more socially useful purposes like childcare and better public services so we get to make the choices about how our taxes are spent much more than we're able to do at the moment morning Andrew I'm very good thanks yourself good mhm mhm okay erm two issues very close to my heart Andrew I've long been a an opponent of nuclear weapons erm fr- from a moral perspective but also from a practical and and financial perspective erm we set out erm in the white paper that we think a a reasonable time scale for Trident being removed from Scotland in the event of independence would be the lifetime of the first Scottish parliament erm you ask a very important question about what happens to Faslane the base where erm Trident is kept at the moment and a very important point to make is that we want to see the end of Trident we don't want to see the closure of Faslane our proposal is that Faslane would become a conventional naval base and it would be the headquarters the Joint Forces Headquarters for forces in an independent Scotland and  erm we estimate that Faslane in that configuration and it would need some work done to reconfigure it erm into that state erm but in that configuration it would support broadly speaking the same number of jobs as it does right now well that's erm you know tha- that would require a transition and very important in mapping out that transition would be the negotiations that we have with the Westminster government about the specific timetable for getting rid of Trident but you know the important point here is that Faslane will continue to be a very important erm military facility in Scotland it simply will not be the home of nuclear weapons I you know I would hope that a UK Government would take the opportunity of independence to decide that it didn't want Trident anymore but that would be a decision for them if if you look ahead at the cost of replacing Trident which all of the UK parties have signed up in one way or another to doing erm there was a report published erm a few weeks ago that says through the twenty twenties that will cost about four billion pounds a year now you know I think that money will be far better spent on things that we really need in Scotland not on weapons that will never be used erm let's all hope and pray would never be used because it would wipe out a huge swathe of our civilisation now Andrew also asked me about the Clyde shipyards erm that is a a subject very close to my heart I used to represent Govan shipyard erm before the the boundaries of my constituency changed erm in terms of the the contract the type twenty six frigate contract erm I believe that contract will go to the Clyde erm regardless of the outcome of the referendum because the Clyde is the best erm I would actually say the only place in the UK erm to construct erm those ships erm they've got the skills they've got the workforce erm they've got the capability to do that and you know if you erm look at the comments that Jamie Webster the erm one of the union convenors at Govan erm made a few weeks ago where he said it was erm a probability that that contract erm would stay on the Clyde longer term of course I've you know long argued the case that we need to be thinking beyond naval contracts for the shipyards erm if you look at Norway erm that's a country similar in size to Scotland it's got many more shipyards than we do erm it constructs ships for its oil industry fishing erm protection vessels so we need to think bigger and longer term about the erm shipyards but I believe and want to see our shipbuilding industry have a vibrant future in independent Scotland and I'm confident that it will have mhm mhm but I think sorry well we would have and we set this out in the white paper a a a requirement of our own four frigates and therefore we would see erm the good sense and joint procurement of the Type twenty six contracts for erm the Clyde we- well for the duration of the Type twenty six but what I'm saying is well for the next ten twenty odd years in terms of the it depends how many of these Type twenty six contracts you well well we said four but the UK government haven't set out how many they're yet going to order well but the point well the point is now I'm not I'm not going to because that depends on what other work you manage to win for the orders well it depends it depends when we start that it depends in terms of well well it's depends on the the phasing of that it depends on how many more erm that are are being done by the UK government I'm not gonna get into kinda crude erm timelines there because it's there are a number of variables there but the point I'm going to make is that if we want a future for our shipyards that is genuinely long-term then we need to think beyond these contracts now the other point I would make is that it is absolutely hypocritical of people on the No side to say that independence is a threat to our yards on the Clyde because Govan right now is being erm put up for closure as part of the Westminster system erm they're going to and I've wow I've just answered in response to Andrew erm the point about our erm long-term plans for Faslane I I don't accept that because we're saying we want rid of Trident because Trident is not a good use of public money but we want Faslane to be a conventional naval base the Joint Forces Headquarters which would support erm broadly speaking the same number of jobs as it does right now so you know there is a future there for Faslane but I make no apology for saying it's a future that doesn't depend on nuclear weapons because I don't believe that nuclear weapons are right for the country good morning Ally right I'd like to ask the Deput- Deputy erm First Minister first and foremost erm this if Scotland gets independent it's going to be the cost is going to be enormous erm we're gonna have to get new passports we're gonna have to have an embassy in every country of the world what's gonna happen to the stock market what's gonna happen to people's pensions that are based in erm in the UK what's gonna happen to the DVLA erm the Pound Sterling erm we've we've been told that we won't keep the Pound Sterling yet we're being told that erm the European Union won't let us become a new member of  of the European Union erm what's gonna happen to road tax what's gonna c- happen to personal tax where does all that come from ? all ? good morning ? where I'm ?  can't you oh you've got a lot of work to persuade me and a lot of relation ? okay embassies yeah can I just interrupt there as long as there's fifty two million people of it i- in England contributing towards this there's only five million people in Scotland contributing towards this good morning Ally good morning Deputy First Minister how are you today fine thank you fine the erm Nicola basically I just wanted to run past you that erm I know Trident is something none of us really particularly want it's an unpleasant sort of thing to have but realistically Nicola what will we do to the place the jobs you know for these submarine bases how long physically would it take to get rid of the actual submarines and the systems and the the other thing I wanted to ask is well Nicola that basically what will happen with the Clyde shipyards if we do go independent erm how can we guarantee order books for these guys Nicola if the the UK parliament pull the plug ? very good point and erm I quite agree with you in that the Govan shipyards Nicola when these current twenty six contracts run out then there was always gonna be huge question marks where the next order was coming from anyway so therefore I get the feeling that it might well be better that you know i- i- if we do go independent that you can say well I I can give you orders for Scottish boats for starters to even if it's just offshore patrol craft or small frigates you don't need great big things and incidentally whilst the aircraft carrier was a a welcome boost for the order book there I just feel that was a waste of money as well a bit twenty years out of date
