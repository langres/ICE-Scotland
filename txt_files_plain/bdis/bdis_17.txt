thank you all very much indeed for joining us to reflect on the list and on the position of women in society we're now joined by buinesswoman Laura Hogg who was a candidate on the TV show The Apprentice the former Labour MSP Pauline McNeill and the showbiz journalist Beverley Lyons erm Pauline what did you make of the top ten indeed the top one hundred and we can take a look now at a another erm few notable names on the list
 two British-based women we've got the Queen in  at number six we've got J K Rowling and we've got celebrities there we've got Shakira and Angelina Jolie erm Beverley ten percent of the list erm is celebrities is that fair do you think what's got Lady Gaga and erm you didn't think it was surprising that the Queen was twenty six Lady Gaga was fourteen mhm Laura what do you think d'you think there's lots of good role models on that list erm twenty five CEOs I mean that's interesting to see so many women at the top erm lots of positives as you say but what d'you think the the obstacles are to getting on the list Pauline ? yes yeah Laura sorry would you aspire to be on the list you touched a little bit women in politics in Scotland I mean two of the the leaders erm of the the groups i- in Scotland are women the deputy erm leader Nicola Sturgeon you know where are we now in Scotland are we in a good place for for women being represented in politics mhm mhm hopefully this list will inspire lots of young women but just out of interest Beverley is anyone that inspired you  i- in the past to do what you're doing what about you Pauline any role models that you aspired to Laura what about you I'll have to stop there thank you all very much indeed for joining us on Scotland Tonight well it's a very impressive list and actually it shows that women have made progress around the world we've got world leaders the president of Brazil is a woman the president of Google is a woman I mean it's astonishing erm but I do think it may mask if you pick too much attention that may ma- mask some of the progress we still need to make much lower down erm when I first went into parliament the Scottish Parliament had the third best representation of women and now we're something like thirty five so I think it's important just to realise there's still a lot more progress to be made and  of course the the gap on pay for women is still dramatically behind men so it's still a lot more work to be done mhm mhm mhm that is that is the most astonishing thing about the list that women are so I mean the I think number thirteen that is a woman is the head of Homeland Security in the United States you know in some ways arguably that may be a much more powerful position well she is helping to run the department in the US  I think it's still a man's world by and large and I think what you see is that we have probably doubled the number of wor- world leaders since two thousand and five but do we look at that so yeah we're still pretty much a man's world coz if you look at I mean take any aspect of of Scottish life you want we don't have fifty percent women judges yet we don't have fifty percent principals of universities so if you actually look at day-to-day life there's still quite a long way to go but as Beverley says I think the great thing about this list is that you've got a huge range of role models for women erm and Lady Gaga and Madonna who's not on it by the way ? coz of the ? three ? erm Middleton ? but any women ?  but they're very clever women I mean the fact that they're celebrities I mean I think Lady Gaga is a very smart woman in terms she's a songwriter and so on so y- I was thinking about this erm I think it's more the women I worked with to be honest and I think that's why we must have role models in your place of work as well as erm celebrities on television erm I mean women I worked with in the parliament like Wendy Alexander who was a Labour leader for a while to have seen up close to women and how hard they work and how they really very very passionate I think women in politics and for more parties I would say to be fair I think it's fair enough I mean not only are these celebrities but erm Forbes made a point of making sure that they were philanthropists in their own right so erm you have people like Angelina Jolie who does great things for the UN you've got Lady Gaga who set up the Born This Way Foundation doing a lot for LGBT causes and bullied youngsters you've got erm Shakira with the her you know her foundation as well and erm Beyonce doing great things sort of leading the way they're role models I mean what is power th- this is what it's all about is it likeability is it the art of influencing is it the expertise is it the authority these ladies have all got it in bags loo- I think wh- what happens here is erm social media has a lot to do with erm the ranking of of some of these people if you take for example Gaga Shakira and Beyonce together they've got fifty million tweets erm followers on Twitter erm I think there's a combined a- amount of ninety million followers amongst the people so you can see the clouds erm that they've got and that certainly probably helps  although obviously it's been a jubilee year for the Queen erm it's perhaps she's not been erm you know as active in in other respects people may think a lot of erm entrepreneurial people a lot emerging from the Asian market as well and of course media gets a good look in erm organisations such as Google Yahoo erm also erm technical or- t- high-tech organisations Hewlett Packard erm IB- well not IBM but  lots of other sort of computer erm ? people coming in as well ? I think on the front bench I think it's erm quite remarkable erm First Minister's question time when Alex Salmond was somewhere else I can't remember Nicola  Sturgeon stood and she had three women on the front bench and it was great to see erm and i- interesting how the tone changes erm when there when there are women in charge so yeah I think at the top levels I think we're doing well I would like to see more women in the parliament I'd like to see us  go back to the record that we held being third b- in the world which is an incredible record oh my mother what can I say you know all teachers as well of course and erm I I think probably that quite a few are dead you know I don't ask me why but Judy Garland but I gue- I guess maybe if I had followed her life pattern it could have all been so different oh definitely erm just like the the ladies have said I think it's just fantastic to see so many people being acknowledged for their achievements and there's such just a wide spectrum which is gonna hit all the different age groups as well I mean I think it is very important to I mean obviously celebrities y- you know it's like they said they got such a big impact as well yes you know they might not be leaders of countries and what not but erm they they do have erm a big claim on sort of day-to-day society whether we like it or not and maybe that's down to the media but erm I would say it was a a pretty fair divide you know I I was quite pleased to see that there were only erm ten percent celebrities which I think w- was was fair I think you have to have that but it was good that it wasn't just full of that and see like world leaders erm right at the top yeah yeah it's true oh definitely that's me in a few years erm no erm I but I think this is a key thing I think it's a fact that you know we we have to have the- these lists so that you know young women are looking at them and going you know what I might not get to that level but y- I can definitely achieve something and you know why not definitely you've got to have ambitions and dreams and erm and that's just the start of it and it is really disproving to people that again back to this erm sort of division of  you know you've got your celebrities on it you've got your politicians on it you've got your world leaders that's a fact that you know you don't just have to be famous to be in the public eye it makes people then go alright okay we know what if I stick in or if I really try hard in erm a certain field you know I can still achieve great great things mhm mhm mhm mhm oh it's such a hard question isn't it erm you know I'm gonna be a bit teasy as well and say you know there's been a lot of strong women in my life erm certainly erm you know my mum as well erm but I suppose like really looking back as you say it's like people like Audrey Hepburn and what not the you know big film stars which have just had even now you know just such a big influence erm on day-to-day even like from things like fashion to films an-
