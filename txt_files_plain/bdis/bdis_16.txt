well joining us now live from Edinburgh is the former Labour spin doctor Simon Pia and here in the studio is the Observer columnist Kevin McKenna thank you both for joining us this evening Simon did you ever think you'd see the day when erm the SNP were ahead of Labour in the battle to win the Westminster seat currently held by Gordon Brown aha okay alright okay well well well let's go to Kevin I mean how has it come to a situation where Scottish Labour could be left with almost no seats after the election bu- well I I mean on that point Simon has Scottish Labour got the right strategy I mean as as as Kevin's saying the message seems to be if you vote SNP you'll end up with this erm erm Tory government erm okay well we're talking about Labour here okay alright Kevin alright Kevin you know is there time for them to to to put out a a new message now or is it is it just too late mhm what should the message be then Kevin yeah erm and erm Simon the the Labour Party people gathering erm in Edinburgh this weekend for their pre-election conference Ed Milliband and Jim Murphy are going to be addressing them wha- what's the mood amongst the the the the Labour people at the moment that you've been speaking to okay erm and erm y- you know how bad d'you think it might be for for Labour in the election in Scotland and if it's really bad what does it mean for the the party's future okay a- and Simon very briefly how bad do you think it might be very briefly okay okay a- and we have to we have to leave it there Simon Kevin well erm I I think these polls aren't as surprising coz this current in trend this forty five percent that is a figure they got in the twenty eleven Scottish elections that was a figure that was replicated in the Referendum so that is probably quite consistent the big question is what happens to the fifty five percent and Labour is making up way a way twenty's percent of that but the the problems go back for over a decade I- I've spoken about this erm many times afore erm Labour should have called erm a Referendum and giving the Scottish people a chance to have their voice and say when I worked with Wendy Alexandra when she laid down to break a on-chance that was a that was an error Wendy also may want to trade big structural changes in the party even in bringing in things like primaries for selecting candidates but the party has atrophied to a certain extent but what I will challenge and I see people like my own mucker Kevin McKenna writing about at times is that Labour is are not the same as the Tories that is arid nonsense and Labour's record investment in health education erm minimum wage record apprenticeship because all these were achievements which have got yeah well well tha- that's probably a reality for Labour are going to lose they have forty one seats and if erm if the polls were are reflecting accurately erm that would be of great benefit to the Tories but it's got to be a lot more than that Kevin's right about that and I think Labour's got to bare its heart and soul and ac- ad- admit mistakes but also remind people and Kevin speaks about forensic scrutiny I don't see that in a lot of the ps- erm pseudo left commentariate that in Scotland about the council tax freeze which one of the most regressive policies erm and if erm that is imposing austerity on local authorities now the SNP I feel get a really easy ride and tha- that is wha- no no no no well you've got to compare the two but that's a comparison that the La- SNP have taken on a social democratic mantle but I I do understand a lot of the the people's disillusion with with  Labour I mean Labour didn't do enough to rectify that erm I it it's it's not erm this has been going on for quite a long time people realise it's a a big ask and erm the the Referendum campaign wasn't a good experience erm so people do know it's a very erm tough call they've got ahead of them but they'll keep plodding away erm there are still t- twenty five to thirty percent of people who are loyal to Labour it's how we win back disillusioned Labour people like Kevin and others like him and to remind them that erm erm just what I was saying about baring your soul that these erm achievements that erm that we ha- we look around that and we have won over decades and even recently b- and I would say that the erm Labour erm executives under McLeish and McConnell were more progressive than the SNPs well it's never over until the the polls shut erm and Labour will fight to the end erm but erm they they do realise they have a huge mountain to climb but there's fifty five percent of the population out there who've got to make a choice and they voted one way in the Referendum the SNP are wanting to replay Referendum Two and I think there are bigger issues in that at stake I think there's a couple of things one there's a payback here from many former Labour voters who were dismayed at erm the way not just the fact that Labour had shared that platform with the Tories during the Referendum campaign but the way in which they did it and so there's payback there the second thing is that I think something fundamental and profound is happening in Scottish politics I think that we have an electorate now which is far more sophisticated than it was a generation ago and they've got much more access to many more sources of information they're much more forensic at erm inspecting and scrutinising party policy now the SNP has managed to ride that wave but that wave actually is threatening to engulf the Labour Party they didn't get it they were late to it the old canard about voting SNP to get the Tories that ship sailed a long long time ago yes erm Rona is i- there's more that with erm two months or so left until May the seventh that the best that Labour in Scotland can come up with is about scaremongering about getting the Tories if you vote SNP erm the SNP got power at Holyrood in two thousand and seven the Labour Party in Scotland had eight years to evolve a new model a social democratic model for Scotland and for the UK well when I'd be reminding voters that an awful lot of the advantages and of all the beneficial social changes that occurred in their lifetime and in the lifetime of their parents came from the Labour Party and no other I'd be saying to them that in in the UK as a whole we want to vote we want to end the or or reduce the poverty gap we want to say that erm if there's going to be an austerity programme people people know voters aren't s- stupid they know there has to be a bit of belt-tightening all they want though is to ensure that if they're gonna be tightening their belts that so will the the elite the very rich people would be asked to tighten their belts to the same sufficiency well I think we're now going beyond what it might erm mean for them in two thousand an- sorry in in May the seventh and possibly even in the Holyrood elections in two thousand and sixteen I think we're now actually talking about the future of the Labour Party in Scotland erm if it doesn't change tack if it doesn't acknowledge that people have become very disaffected their their core vote they're lost they're lost for a generation
