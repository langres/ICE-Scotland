well earlier we spoke with Calum Steele General Secretary of the Scottish Police Federation and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie Calum Steele did Sir Stephen House about the inevitable was his position of erm staying on until next year untenable Willie Rennie you'd called for Sir Stephen House to resign will this help restore public confidence in Police Scotland what are the deep-rooted problems Willie Rennie Calum Steele would you agree with that about the accountability the stop and search the the targets is that the pro- are those the problems erm Willie Rennie wha- what about erm Stephen House's erm successes erm he's delivered some very impressive erm policing results particularly  on erm rape and erm domestic violence how would you assess his record in office and Willie Rennie you were never in favour of a a single Police Scotland in the in the first place erm what do you think should be done now with Police Scotland to make it in your eyes fit for purpose erm yes but Willie Rennie where we are where we are now erm you know we we have got one single police force so what do you think needs to be done would that help restore confidence Callum okay and we'll have to leave it there Calum Steele and Willie Rennie in Dundee thank you both for joining us this evening well joining us now is the Justice Secretary Michael Matheson thanks for joining us this evening erm so Stephen House is standing down it's in December erm is he going of his own volition or was he pushed did you want him to see out his full contract but would you have liked to have seen him stay on until next year okay erm Stephen House is leaving our police force which is said to be suffering a budget crisis we heard Calum Steele there from the Police Federation saying there's no money erm talking about the lack of money and he's not the only one that's complaining erm today the Scottish Police Authority chairman Vic Emery said a- you always knew it'd be difficult this year  but I have to say if we think this year's difficult wait till next year and these concerns are held across senior ranks erm in the police force what are you gonna do to address this but this process this reorganisation's cost a huge amount of money okay but but in the short term what do you say to to Calum Steele and to Vic Emery okay we heard Willie Rennie and erm Calum Steele talking about what they perceive to be deep-rooted problems it's not gonna change just because Stephen House is leaving they talk about the top erm top-down targets erm do you accept there are problems there yes but Calum Steele from the Police Federation was complaining about it aw- as well it wasn't just Willie Rennie okay Justice Secretary Michael Matheson thanks for joining us this evening I think untenable would be erm remarkably unfair erm but I I don't think it's much of a surprise to anyone that he that he was going to erm retire before the end of his contract erm I think it's remarkable that the the news today came as a surprise for everyone given the propensity with which information leaks from the police services Scotland I I I would certainly agree that the issue of erm stop and search and targets was probably the  the start of a of a very serious body brought to the service erm and in d- I think in absolute fairness tha- it has to be said that that's something that the the the federation spoke out against very vociferously from the beginning and was erm a persistent critic of erm but I I do find that the the whole erm issue of erm scrutiny and accountability within the service erm seems to be built upon a a false premise of what used to go before erm the the former police boards and auth- and authorities where they existed were erm remarkably poor at erm holding their Chief Constables to account and for all its faults erm and there are many erm at this moment in time the Scottish Police Authority is still much better erm at holding the service to account erm and scrutinising the service I don't think any genuine erm observer of the service just now would say they are certainly not beeing scrutinised  erm I I would fundamentally disagree that his successes have been outweighed by failures the the you know the reality is that erm he was given a  a very difficult job erm you know the the police service restructured and reorganised against a background of extreme austerity erm the amount of money that had to be cut from the service to deliver an effective policing service across Scotland erm was eye-watering and continues to be eye-watering erm you know the the Chief Constable and he is still the Chief Constable has delivered against that background   now the the- th- there is some undoubted reality that some of the price of that has come erm in terms of erm how erm  erm my members in particular how they how how they f- they they feel at this moment in time they they are tired erm they erm in ma- in many areas they are at breaking point erm but the service erm in its own right continues to be a very effective police service erm we g- get nearly four million calls from the public each year a- and erm with little exception erm they're responded to and dealt with very effectively erm I suspect it probably would but the one thing that's missing in all of this is the is the reality of the shm- money there is no money erm the service needs money to be able to do all that's asked of it erm and it's already saved the combined equivalent of the entire budget of the former northern erm erm Dumfries and Galloway and erm erm central Scotland police forces erm that that lack of money has created erm needs to to undertake some fairly difficult erm erm organisational erm structures erm and unless the question of money is going to be addressed and the the challenges within the service are not going to go away by erm having some tinkering around the margins I mean I think it was inevitable that he was going to go but if we think that we're gonna solve all the problems within Police Scotland by removing the Chief Constable then I think we're deluding ourself we do need to look at the deep-rooted problems that exist within the force to try and restore the confidence of the rank and file police officers as well as the civilians and also members of the public it's been battered and bruised over recent years since centralisation and we need to make some big changes I mean if you look at I mean for instance that ? spoke at the Federation Conference erm last year they were talking about the top-down targets and controls that were imposed when the kind of Strathclyde model was transferred right across Scotland and that kind of thing is demoralising staff but we've also seen stop and search armed police but also the accountability arrangements the Scottish Police authority simply doesn't work very well and we need to look at all these things to try and restore that confidence I think there's no doubt that he's done some positive work in those particular areas erm but I think he is probably th- all the other areas has cast a shadow on his time within the police force yeah I think there'll be not very many people that erm would want him to have have to have stayed in that position erm so I think it's erm quite clear that although he has had some successes they've been outweighed by the failures well erm first of all the SNP need to accept that they got it wrong they should not have centralised the police force within Scotland we warned about many many of these issues Alison McInnes who has led for us on this issue has been like a terrier on this and she has been proved to be right well what we need to look at is that target culture we need to look at the Strathclyde model being writ large across Scotland we need to look at the accountability arrangements to review those so it's much more accountable so we put democracy and local democracy back into the police because it's been removed all of those areas I think will go a big way to try and restoring confidence within Police Scotland well as erm cabi- erm as the Chief Constable said today he wants to move on to try and erm develop some other opportunities and we respect that and we also recognise a very significant legacy that he has created here in Scotland through his tenure as the Chief Constable at Strathclyde erm and also as First Chief Constable of erm Police Scotland and I think he leaves a very considerable legacy in erm his dedication to policing in Scotland well we respect his decision that he wants to move on to try and pursue erm new opportunities and that erm we're now going through a process of looking to identify a new Chief Constable for erm Police Scotland and that will be taken forward over the next couple of months well policing and the funding of policing is no different to the rest of the public sector nor is the austerity policies which are being pursued by the Westminster government are having a very severe impact on the Scottish government's budget and that means that we have to look at making sure that our public services are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible and one of the reasons for moving towards a single force was to end the duplication that we had across eight different legacy forces who were doing eight different things in eight different ways with eight different systems for doing so and to make sure that that money could be freed up for investing and policing so but what it has allowed us to do is also to make sure that we're focusing on the resources to make sure that they're being used for frontline services as most effectively as it can be now we could take the approach that they've taken in England and that is to maintain the police forces in the old former legacy approaches but  had we done that we would have been in the same position they're down south and having to lay off almost sixteen thousand police officers well there are real challenges in making sure that the police budget  is used as efficiently and effectively as possible and there are still areas where efficiencies can be gained and I've got no doubt that  the Chief Constable just now while he remains in post and the incoming Chief Constable will be continuing to look at how they can make sure that they're using their budget to its maximum and reducing levels of duplication there are still some systems that the police are using in police Scotland which are part of the old legacy system which can be used much more effectively and will allow us to get more efficiency through the resources that we have in Police Scotland just now a- let's keep in mind it's important that we also respect the  operational responsibility of the Chief Constable to determine what's the best way in which to run erm the police force and the issues around targets that Willie Rennie was going on about is a matter which the Chief Constable taken forward as a way of trying to make sure that there was a erm a consistency of approach accross the country ? yeah they've created they have created some challenges for members within the police servuce as well and that's a matter that we have to respect that is for the Chief Constable to determine how best to take that forward and then the issue of erm stop and search I've set up the independent advisory group under John ? to look at this whole issue and they were reporting to me in the  erm next week or two and what's the best way to move forward in addressing some of the concerns around erm stop and search so there's already quite a level of that that's been taken forward to address some of the concerns which have been raised and I think that once we make further progress these years we'll continue to build on the strengths that we already have with Police Scotland
