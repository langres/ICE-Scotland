well joining us now is James Chalmers a professor of Law at Glasgow University the journalist Dani Garavelli and Cate Cairney spokesperson for the families of two women who were killed in two thousand and ten when they were hit by a car in Glasgow and she's the aunt of one of those victims thank you all very much indeed erm for joining us and James first of all how useful has this fatal erm accident inquiry been in terms of telling us exactly what happened on the day and reaction of the families erm Dani erm fatal accident inquiries should normally erm bring closure to victims' families but that doesn't really seem to be the case erm in this incident erm Cate erm as we said in the introduction your niece died erm in an accident two thousand and ten with her friend when erm the driver of a Landrover blacked out at the wheel erm when you were at that fatal accident inquiry you and the rest of the family what what did that achieve for you so there was very little closure for you in that erm James what have we learned from this inquiry that in terms of lessons erm so that this  you know accident can't an accident like this can't happen again would you agree with that Dani that it's highlighted failures in the in the system erm Cate you spent s- some time erm in the inquiry this inquiry erm that must've been very difficult for you erm well erm yeah Harry Clarke wasn't erm prosecuted by the Crown Office I think many people struggled to understand erm that decision James do you think Dani that they could have been  clearer coz they just gave out a very small statement didn't they erm what message erm do you think it sends out Cate that that neither men we- were prosecuted e- 
erm  well I mean at the moment there is no way of holding people to account is there if they they lie about their medical erm background I mean do you think that should be changed d'you think that's something that will come out of this would you agree with that Cate erm erm there were times during this fatal accident inquiry though that felt more like the trial of of Harry Clarke are you uncomfortable at all with that James and and how likely is a private prosecution do you think I mean there's very rare was it two in a hundred years or something in Scotland would you agree with that James highly unlikely did you ever consider erm a private prosecution Cate the families
 okay okay and we will have to leave it there but thank you all very much indeed for joining us this evening on Scotland Tonight well it has told us a great deal about the the causes o- of what led up to wh- what happened on the day we obviously knew already the the bare bones of of the incidence itself but we didn't know about Mister Clarke's medical history we we didn't know erm about the the detail o- of his coz it was with the D- DVLA  and so and that's what's been brought out with this process  well you see I think even it's just clear from your report that the different parties to the inquiry have different views on on what the lessons are to be taken from this but one of the key issues is the difficulty of relying on the system which relies itself on the self-reporting to the DVLA like people whose livelihoods depend on continuing to be able to drive mhm I think one of the problems here's the Crown's not been very clear at all with this explanation for not prosecuting may- we got maybe some  erm hint at the reasoning today when I think Lesley Thomson I understand suggested that even if Mister Clarke had been entirely open and honest about what happened in twenty ten he would have got his licence back he would have got his licence back before th- this incident so it wouldn't necessarily have prevented him driving erm not necessarily for Glasgow City Council in erm i- in a bin lorry so and that's the difficulty for the crime that a prosecution would have to prove that he was careless or dangerous legally on that day not simply that he was careless or dangerous by continuing to drive back in twenty ten mhm
 well I think the way the FAI played it out erm because of the possibility of prior prosecution  was unfortunate because this was the one occasion of which Harry Clarke could have been asked to give a full account of exactly what it was that had happened even if there's a primary prosecution he could refuse to give evidence there so if the FAI had taken place with the ? from prosecution erm at least we would have got a full account from him his explanation of why he did wha- what he did as it was there was perhaps even more focus on him because he wasn't answering questions and it erm as as you said it became like the trial of Harry Clarke had been the FAI ? is not really meant to be mhm what way you have you use for we have ? and such as a hundred and seventy insults to the dead talking about the number of questions that there weren't answered that there's going to be an argument erm in court ? aware of the prosecutioner you can't have a fair trial because of that atmosphere that's how the Scottish courts tend to be v- very sceptical a- about those ? but it's it's one more thing that would make a prosecution very difficult no certainly not I mean erm erm I think vic- erm relatives do look for their questions to be answered and if they can be confident recommendations will be made at the end that will stop prevent erm the same thing happening again then then obviously that helps in the healing process but this one has raised more questions than it's answered I think and erm and there gonna be I the- I think there's a huge feeling of frustration at the end of it all yeah there's a the- there's a failures in the system and in the way the DVLA erm liaises with the medical profession I mean erm we we heard that if you apply for a HGV licence you'll be seen by a medical examiner who will know n- nothing about your medical records and erm will not cross-refer with your GP so y- really as  as James says you're totally relying on tha- that person telling the truth at that point I think the lack of transparency's been appalling and I think they wou- erm to say that there's no evidence is really not enough we need t- we need to as happens in England in controversial cases we need the the the system of decision-making to be transparent so we can all you know scrutinise it basically I mean there's all sorts of confusion over the timing of it because the Crown says it was in receipt of all the relevant information at the time it took the decision but the FAI says that they didn't find out about the the first bus incident until February a Crown statement came out on February the twenty fifth you know these things need to be clarified
 yeah well I very much hope so and I think that tha- it would be within you know the DVLA could erm be more robust and it could start prosecuting people for erm just simple non-disclosure and if it erm and that would send the message out that that is not a trivial offence but I also think it would be quite good if we had some kind of public awareness campaign that would stigmatise that in the same way that you know we have managed to stigmatise drink-driving and we have managed to stigmatise being driving when you're exhausted I mean e-  erm you know people ought to be clear that there are consequences to non-disclosure it seems like a very slim chance for now and I think in addition to the to the to those to the fact that it is rare there is also the the the prospect of it being of people raising they don't make the the it might might be impossible for him to get a fair trial now with so much having been in the public domain already and so much controversy over it absolutely nothing I think we're erm we expected anwers we expected  erm justice and we expected erm some statement t- to say what had led to that and and what was gonna happen after that again we had the  similar instance with the DVLA relying on the D four erm the the lying to the doctors and the all of the erm erm medical professionals erm we had a bumbling FAI which was absolutely a shambles erm and as a result of that it's well-documented that we've we've got a complaint absolutely nothing absolutely erm all of us erm Mhairi's mum and dad my sister erm who's Laura's mum and myself attended we w- attended both days that erm the driver was on the stand slightly different in in erm in our case with William Payne erm the- he had a life charge hanging over him and the Crown Office erm couldn't decide what they were gonna do erm right up until March two thousand fifteen erm before they actually di- said they wouldn't gonna prosecute so for us it was erm we wanted to see how the Crown approached that difference with Lesley Thomson leading erm and and what Harry Clarke was actually gonna say but it was like Groundhog Day for us I think it sends out the totally wrong message
 I think that it says basically DVLA are saying do you know what fill in the form it doesn't matter we're not gonna prosecute you and the Crown Office are rubber-stamping that  by saying it doesn't matter you if you want to act if you take out behind the wheel we're not gonna prosecute you it's absolutely fine irrespective of who you have lied to I think it's a very very poor message no absolutely one hundred per cent we have been pushing hard in our case for for four and a half nearly five years coming up at Christmas we've been knocking on the door of the Crown Office we've been pleading with erm Frank Mullholland for a meeting and it was only in July of this year where we actually spoke to the Solicitor General Lesley Thomson and again it's about we don't want this to happen to any other family what happened to Laura and Mhairi erm our lawyers and Digby Brown who 've been tremendous through supporting us all through this we did talk about it erm our's this sl- was a slightly different case  because the Crown held  the charge throughout the fatal accident inquiry and didn't actually publics- publish the revocation until early this year so we're still in that place wha- about what are our next steps
