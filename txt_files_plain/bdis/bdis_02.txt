what would independence mean for TV in Scotland will we still get the same programmes or will we have Strictly Come Highland Dancing Mister Thompson thank you Mister Kennedy thank you erm our next question is from erm the ? ? and Mister Kennedy could you take this one please does Scotland need Trident thank you erm Mister Thompson d- does does Scotland erm really need Trident our next question comes from ? please question Mister Kennedy will tuition fees be introduced in Scotland in the near future our next question is from Emily Morrison Emily please so a- as Scotland has more of an ageing population Mister Kennedy than anywhere else in the UK would funding the benefit system not prove more burdensome for an independent Scotland okay I'll I'll leave that just now I'm sorry we carry on with that question I do apologise he's a he's a rich tea biscuit sorry Mister Thompson I will let you speak this time erm as Scotland is more of an ageing population than anywhere else in the UK would funding the benefit system not prove more burdensome in independent Scotland I think we're just gonna take one final question now and erm this one's a very pertinent one to erm the the people of Skye and it comes from Fi- Finn Oakes Finn please Mister Kennedy wi- will independence be good for the Gaelic language and might everyone have to learn Gaelic in school like they have to learn Welsh in Wales Mister Thompson erm will the Gaelic language erm be affected in an independent Scotland well I suppose we could have Strictly Come Highland Dancing if somebody wanted to produce that and if anybody wanted to watch it yeah I mean there's no reason why not erm the TV is a very interesting thing because some of the No campaigners claim that we wouldn't be able to watch EastEnders and Coronation Street and Doctor Who  erm the big edition of Doctor Who that went out which went out to seventy countries around the world  I believe but if Scotland was independent  we wouldn't get it come on you know get real about these things we would have a Scottish broadcasting corporation we would have licence fees  gathered in Scotland we would commission erm programmes and we would buy programmes in  just like every single country in the rest of the world does they buy the programmes in the the programmes that the people want to watch we'd have our own programmes and we'd have a mix of programmes from other countries as well there are a number of issues here I suppose and looking specifically at Trident erm it's gonna cost a hundred billion pounds over the next twenty five years to replace Trident to renew Trident and the UK actually signed up to the what they call the non- proliferation treaty which is a treaty that commits everyone who signs it to reduce the number of nuclear warheads et cetera that they have by renewing Trident we are actually increasing our capability because the warheads will be probably much more powerful and we're spending a hundred thousand million pounds to do it now people say that Trident is a deterrent look around you the world at the moment look at all the wars that have happened since erm the end of the Second World War nineteen forty five all these wars happenend ? the Iraq war and including the Russians going into Ukraine recently Trident nuclear missiles didn't stop any of that so what is it actually deterring what it does is it gives the UK a a card that it can play so it can sit with the top five countries in the world  play with the big boys play war games with the big boys America and and and others and it gives them that seat at the top table which they like they like being important on a world stage if Scotland gets inde- our independence in September if you the people vote for it Trident will be out of Scotland within the as soon as possible certainly within the term of the first parliament that will not only save us an awful lot of money it'll probably save the rest of the UK an awful lot of money because I they don't really have anywhere else to put it erm there've been studies done which erm really discount most places in England and Wales and Northern Ireland they're thinking about maybe putting it over to America it's already dominated by America a lot of it comes from America we would never use Trident independently without American approval so Trident is totally unnecessary extremely expensive and if we used it it is indiscriminate in who it kills it doesn't just kill soldiers fighting in a war it kills everybody men women children young and old and then it would create a nuclear winter probably when Chernobyl the nuclear power station in Russia blew up a few years ago we had radiation in the hills of the west of Scotland and sheep and lambs couldn't be sold because radiation travels in the wind if you let off nuclear weapons and they come from both sides it's mutually assured destruction M A D or MAD and it is mad we need to get rid of them and set an example what a wonderful thing for a newly independent Scotland to set an example against immoral and evil weapons of mass destruction thanks convener erm I was still happier with Charles' answer because yes we we agreed on erm on the tuition fees issue but that's another reason why I think a Yes vote is the right way to go because in an independent Scotland Charles and I would be on the same side on that social justice side and the reason you pay tuition fees is because we believe that if you are able then you should get the education to allow you to reach your full potential it should not be dependent on how much money your parents have the country benefits from your education and the country would rea- reap massive tax benefits by well-educated I don't know it does well-educated young people so that's a real a bonus I think and I think the majority of people in Scotland erm would be for that and many other social justice issues in terms of the ageing population erm if you look at the Highlands and Islands and look at the number of young people between sixteen and twenty nine look at the two thousand and one Census and the two thousand and eleven Census you'll see that we in the Highlands and Islands back in two thousand and one had seventeen percent less young sixteen to twenty nine year-olds than the rest of Scotland so where did all our young people go they left the Highlands and Islands the Highlands and Islands enterprise worked out that that was ten thousand young people aged sixteen to twenty nine who had to leave the Highlands some of them would have chosen to go many had no choice if they wanted their further and higher education and if they wanted top jobs why is that that after s- over three hundred years of the United Kingdom we are still losing our young people at that rate that's beginning to be reversed because the Scottish government the SNP government have helped the university at the Highlands and Islands to established itself and it's a decentralised university we hear an awful lot about centralisation these days it's a decentralised university with colleges all over the Highlands and Islands and it is beginning to allow young people to stay in the Highlands and Islands if they wish to further higher and further education that's going to boost our population of young people because with that there will be the creation of ever more good top quality jobs and not only that we are already attracting young people from other parts of Europe erm in our church in Inverness that we go to in Ken Miles there's a young Dutch girl that's just finished her four-year degree in Inverness and there are many more examples of that across the Highlands so the way you deal with the age demographics and actually we spend a smaller proportion of our total cash on benefits including pensions than the rest of the UK does so we're actually in a better position the way you sort it is make sure your young folk if they wish can stay here and prosper and grow your economy that's how you deal with these issues well erm ? ? erm ? ? I've got some Gaelic and I did a course in Inverness erm I did a full year in Inverness back in two thousand and three at the college there they haven't heard of something called satellite TV which respects no borders whatever decision individual countries take anyway my goodness look around the Highlands and Islands how many communities are dependent on satellite TV to get any TV erm  because if you're dependent on this terrestrial service erm you still in certain areas wouldn't have the coverage so erm it's a nonsense of the first order so it will not affect erm some of the erm any of the programmes erm that would otherwise be available erm nor should it erm and I don't know about erm Strictly Come Highland Dancing a few years ago I was asked would you believe erm don't laugh but you will to contribute erm to Dancing on Ice erm I turned it down erm politely on the basis that in my case it would be better renamed erm dancing on thin ice erm not necessarily no and indeed Trident itself erm leaving aside the big arguments the moral arguments about should you be in possession of nuclear weapons or not erm just put that to one side for a second in terms of the individual weapon system which is what you asked about erm there is absolutely no specific overwhelming argument for having Trident Trident was a replacement for something else which was a replacement for something else and indeed Trident itself has been modified in the course of its lifetime to reduce the number of warheads that it carries so I've never actually seen this debate as an argument about do you have a weapon system or not and if you do which one should you have  that's to me whether we're independent or remaining part of the UK  is an argument that still got to be further examined and it will be an argument whether Scotland's independent or not which will be inextricably linked with the Americans and with the rest of NATO and I'm sure Dave will ? say about that and I won't prejudge it erm in terms of whether Scotland should be in possession of nuclear weapons erm I think myself that we're still moving and have to continue to move towards a world where you have a phase reduction in nuclear weapons all round that you can use what you possess as part of that negotiating process but I've never been persuaded that just making a great sincere statement and gesture in saying we'll give them up and that's it is actually the best way forward erm I don't surrender something completely to somebody else  I use it like them to do something that's correct it's my way of thinking by way of return in a principled way so I think we should use them as a negotiating tool downwards rather than pursue a line which just says we've got rid of them aren't we marvellous and actually everybody else has still got them and other countries as we know are still trying to get them that's where I'm coming from in that issue in Trident well I very much hope not erm as was being said in fact David was saying it in erm in his speech erm towards the end of the debate erm none of us can know what future government is going to be in power in Scotland whether Scotland's independent or it's erm governed as it is at the moment but I would think it's highly unlikely looking at the balance of arguments that any of the Scottish political parties with perhaps the exception of the Conservatives but certainly the other three Labour SNP would then are going to in Scotland embrace student tuition fees so unless the Conservatives and they've got some way to go erm were to win a majority in a future Scottish parliament independent or not erm then I don't see that policy ever seeing the light of day and thank goodness for that because it's a a mistaken erm ill-judged wrong-headed policy and I've always thought that and that's why I voted accordingly as I say at Westminster against it erm so we're escaping tuition fees at the moment that's a good thing and as far as I can see whatever structure of Scottish politics and whatever party or parties in combination in future governments in Scotland I don't see tuition fees being started yeah sorry maybe I missed something David I don't think wh- i- just when the tuition fees ? did you last I think we're singing off the same hymn sheet here but e- even so tha- tha- that's all I don't want you to think we've bought the Chairman you know that is erm the erm he was too expensive we tried but he was at too high a price yeah erm yeah I mean the demography of Scotland erm we have erm a higher than average in the UK sense erm ageing population we come to the Highlands and Islands that becomes even more so and that's expensive as we know erm we now have smaller families less proportion of young people compared with older people older people it's a good thing that people are living longer obviously but it costs more and if you've got less people younger people in work you've got less tax so you got what is going back I think it was Arthur I can't remember who said earlier in the debate it's already been full ? intersectable with Scotland this week well there'll be quite a few more judging by this alarm that's ? off from time to time erm so you've got an upside down pyramid more older people costing more up there less younger people generating less tax to support it down here and that's a real problem for the whole society not just the United Kingdom it's ? right across Europe as well would it be more expensive more difficult in Scotland yes I think it would be because that problem is even more pronounced the demography erm within Scotland erm and it would be more difficult for us to fund that provision and this is where I come back to erm the claims and the counter claims we can be pretty sure that these demographics are not gonna change and are going to accelerate so that problem as many of us know from our own families is liable to get worse as time goes on or more challenging as time goes on and therefore it would be more difficult I go back to what I said I think Scotland erm would be up for tackling it as best it could that might involve more tax that may be a good thing it may be a bad thing people will have to judge that erm if and when it arises but it will be more difficult for Scotland on its own given at the moment without doubt not impossible but more difficult thank you erm I think on the latter point no erm I don't think that there will be compulsion erm of that nature erm for Gaelic or erm is concerned erm whatever constitution arrangements we have I don't envisage that that being introduced or imposed upon people erm will independence be good for Gaelic erm I would tend to say neutral myself actually erm I don't think it would necessarily provide an enormous boost to Gaelic erm I don't think that independence would necessarily beat down on Gaelic erm erm to any extent either erm the problem the issue facing Gaelic I don't think is one of political structures when we look at the last Census results erm they were pretty concerning I mean UK governments and successive Scottish governments now erm have put a lot of political and financial support to ? Gaelic and yet erm it's discouraging to see that the numbers are still heading in the wrong direction despite all the considerable input that's been there across the political spectrum Westminster and Holyrood erm and I don't see independence per se is good to change that I think that this is part of a much bigger debate but for the purposes of the debate we're having here today I would say independence is likely to be neutral erm I think any government in an independent Scotland would be as politically supportive of Gaelic as have the governments in Scotland and in more recent years in Westminster as well but it hasn't enabled Gaelic to turn the corner yet erm and the Welsh example is a good one I don't favour compulsion but I favour some of the things they've done in Wales which have put their language on an upward path where Gaelic is at best cruising steady and slightly dipping in the wrong direction does Scotland really need Trident   is it a consension erm will tuition fees be introduced in Scotland in the future as Scotland has more of an aging population than anywhere else in the UK would funding the benefit system not prove more burdensome for an independent Scotland will independence be good for the Gaelic language and might everyone have to learn Gaelic in schools like they have to learn Welsh in Wales
