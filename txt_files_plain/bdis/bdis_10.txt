this is a a specific example of a much more generic issue erm in terms of erm what the commission's about and how it's going to put together a package which is gonna find resonance out there amongst the population erm a p- a dry package of powers or power transfer isn't gonna cut the mustard with the population there's gonna have to be some some sprinkling of magic dust in some way and that means necessarily spending some of your time talking about erm relationships and people rather than just structures and systems erm and so the the solution to this particular problem is you find uni- unanimity around this table erm in terms of the the level of frustration at the lack of people's ability and I wouldn't call it a conspiracy in- but I would it's a it's a result of chosen behaviours which people have decided that that's how they're going to behave or not behave and so the the lack of integration between the the two parliaments and the two governments is a result of people actually deciding that that's what they're going to do and in answer to your earlier question at- about what can you do about that you're doing it today because you're here in this building and you're integrating in a way which UK bodies and Scottish bodies haven't done in the past so you know one example that we highlight in our submission the Scottish select committee should meet in this building it is ridiculous that it doesn't meet in this building and there should be an an ability for people like us round the table to engage with that erm particular erm group erm and a whole range of others and so there's there's that there's just that magic dust about relationships and people that somehow you need to reflect or be it that your focus has to be on the transfer of power erm Michael Moore and then Linda Fabiani Lin- oh sorry Mary much erm Linda Fabiani erm yeah building on erm Ian's observation earlier on erm both Ian and I know erm what the modern Scotland office is like and I know from erm many of you round the table here colleagues upstairs erm you know how challenging erm it was and remains to represent the UK government in Scotland with the amount of time and resource that is available to the Scotland office on the practical steps I mean I was very encouraged about what erm everybody's said so far Margaret put her finger on it right at the start and Adam has tried to tease this out a bit erm erm would a statutory right of consultation for representative bodies in the devolved areas of the United Kingdom begin to address practically the issues that you've talked about and a bill brought up in terms of funding access so there's a presumption that all parts of the United Kingdom are appropriately considered erm you know you make your judgements later about how well their thoughts have been taken on board but at least that they are approached and dealt with and in terms of structures of government min- erm my colleagues have heard me erm going on about this a little bit already erm ? time ? at the school erm there is a system of committees the joint ministerial committees between UK and erm devolved administration ministers erm which erm the better bits of it work well but vast areas of UK policy making are not represented in them other than under the derisory title of the Home Committee that will consider everything from welfare to energy to culture media and sport when it becomes relevant erm having m- greater formality but that would that help to drive the system do you believe erm it doesn't quite bring the human face erm that erm erm Ross has been mentioning just now erm but it would it seems to me perhaps lead us in the right direction does that make sense I I'd like to make erm th- we are straying way beyond the SFHA submission on this erm terrain but just to m- to m- make a point here that I think I would echo what's been said already erm en- entirely and I think in pursuit of the magic dust erm argument I think I want to make the point that I th- at the the issues are as much cultural and ignorance and neglect and so what needs to be put in place is some kind of mechanism that combats that erm and that requires it to happen because once the dialogue starts I'm confident that it would actually produce erm better understanding and and more attention to the differences erm a- but it but it's it's it's cultural that roots and so you need structural mechanisms to start to combat some of that yeah erm I I think what I'm a wee bit concerned about in this discussion is that we're talking about so far making the status quo work better and when you know we're looking at what we're trying to achieve here and I look at my experience in different committees with with some of the same people that are here sitting round very often it's not just about consultation and participation about what is happening but it is back to the cultural thing that Mary was talking about a lack of recognition of differences in Scotland erm not just the fluffy stuff about how we do things but very structural differences and and I would bring in and back off Mary erm the bedroom tax erm for example the sheer impracticality of implementing something like that because the infrastructure was not there to be allowed to implement it and there was absolutely no recognition of that at all in any participation consultation discussion with the UK government erm Scottish government or indeed erm the people that are directly involved so I'm just very keen to make sure that we're not just talking about structures here we are talking about additional powers so that things that are implemented that are erm whatever comes out of this commission and the UK government's still the responsibility of the UK government have a recognition that sometimes things here are very very different
