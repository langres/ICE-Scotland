well we start off the debate with opening statements from both leaders erm Mister Salmond erm you won the toss of a coin and chose to go first thank you very much that was the opening statement from Alex Salmond and now it's time to hear from the leader of the Better Together campaign Alistair Darling Alistair Darling thank you very much indeed erm let's erm start tonight's discussion with our poll right at the top erm Alex Salmond this poll gives a very very commanding lead to the No campaign poll after poll after poll gives a lead to the No campaign they can't all be wrong can they and I suppose erm Alistair Darling that given poll after poll after poll shows that you are well in the lead you can't possibly lose this can you okay well one of the things which we often hear from people and I dare say that we'll hear it from our audience tonight is that what they want to hear in this debate is a sense of vision of the kind of country Scotland can be now clearly within the union you believe that that is the best way in order to build economic prosperity in order to deliver social justice I've heard both leaders talk about economic prosperity and social justice why do you believe that that is only possible operating within the terms of the union okay and of course if there is a yes-vote on the eighteenth of September we have a constitutional erm revolution the powers that would then accrue to the Scottish parliament would be much greater than they are at the moment why do you believe that it's only through the powers of independence that you can actually deliver a competitive economy and a socially just country one of the issues which is often talked about erm in relation to independence is the is the issue of risk now you're inviting everybody at home here tonight and everybody in this audience to vote yes on the eighteenth of September if they vote yes surely what they're giving you is a mandate to negotiate independence and you can't eyeball people here tonight and tell them the shape of that independence how long it will take or lay out for them a detailed blueprint for the future of their country isn't it simply a statement of fact that a yes-vote contains a high element of risk okay well let's stay for a moment erm let's stay for a moment on this whole issue of risk because you Alistair Darling and many people who support the Better Together campaign have talked up the element of risk but surely for many people who are poor at the moment pensioners who get a pension which is well down the European league table the risk is actually remaining with the union than within the union because for them the risk is that the union will keep them poor and will keep pensioners poor okay erm if there's a if there's a no-vote if there's a no-vote then we have had this declaration today from the leaders of the UK parties there will definitely be more powers accruing to Scotland give me two powers that will definitely accrue which tax all of it all of it now now the leaders today could not have been clearer in what they said Alex Salmond tell the folk here if after the twenty fifteen election the government whatever the complexion is at Westminster comes forward with measures which will enhance the powers of the Scottish parliament can we take it that SNP MPs will definitely vote yes no no my my my my question my question was my question wa- my my question was in relation to a no-vote can can you tell us what SNP MPs would do in that context yes okay Ali- tha- tha- that's very briefly ? very briefly okay let me take let me take one or two points of you from the audience erm can we take the chap in the black shirt and the tie yes sir okay I want okay I wanna take two or three points of you just basically on what you've heard in the opening exchanges can erm can we have the chap in the third row yup with the green shirt yes sir okay and I would like a contribution from the lady yup just up there thank you erm and can I take a contribution from somebody who's going to vote no specifically no yes the chap there in the the sort of salmon pink shirt yes sir okay I promise we will come back to these issues a lot of good issues there erm there's much more debate to come but let's cross back to John MacKay in our spin room and welcome back to the first referendum debate between First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together leader Alistair Darling in this section both guests will have twelve minutes each to cross-examine one another I don't want to have to intervene but I will if they continually interrupt one another well Mister Darling won the toss of a coin and decided to go first Alistair Darling Alis- Alistair Darling question from Mister Darling please question questions a question please question please let let let Mister Salmond answer the question Mister Salmond question please questions let let Mister Salmond answer the question Mister Salmond okay okay Alistair wait w- we have two minutes left question please Mister Darling let's Mis- Mister Salmond thank you Bernard erm ladies and gentlemen few people now very few people dispute the fact that Scotland could be a successful independent country and why should they we've just had the most enormously successful Commonwealth Games here in the city of Glasgow new f- no fewer than forty nine of the seventy one competing countries and territories in the Commonwealth Games are either the same size or smaller than Scotland in the European Union no fewer than twelve of the twenty eight member countries are the same size or smaller than Scotland and few if any of these countries possess the the natural and human resources that this country of Scotland is blessed with so the question is not should or could we become an independent country the question is should we be an independent country and that's the the question I intend to answer firstly within ten miles of where I'm standing in Glasgow there are thirty five food banks in this city and its surroundings how is it in this prosperous country of Scotland we have thousands of children with families families with children in this prosperous country relying on food banks within twenty five miles of where I'm standing there is Europe's largest concentration of weapons of mass destruction and the UK government intends to spend an obscene a hundred thousand million pounds over the next generation in keeping on there and that would mean t- eight billion pounds of Scotland's money a- and thirdly for more than half of my life Scotland has been governed by parties that we didn't elect at Westminster a- and these parties have given us from everything from the the poll tax to the bedroom tax and they are the same people who through project fear are telling us that this country can't run our own affairs my case this evening is simple no one absolutely no one will do a better job of running Scotland than the people who live and work in Scotland on the eighteenth of September we have the opportunity of a lifetime we should seize it with both hands thank you well I I'm encouraged that we're gaining ground at this poll up four per cent erm and if we take the average of polls when we launched the white paper on independence last September it was erm thirty seven per cent polls over the last few days the average is forty five per cent so it's no question the Yes campaign is gaining ground we're moving in to the the last six weeks of this campaign my experience tells me that erm to win an election or a referendum you've got to win the arguments erm you've got to win the hearts and minds of the people and if we win that win the hearts and minds of the people then Bernard we'll win this referendum Bernard it was interesting Bernard when you asked erm Alistair for a a vision o- o- of Scotland what he told you was how good he thought  the union was erm what I would say is my vision for Scotland is to have a prosperous country but also to have a a just society in the last year in Scotland thirty thousand more children have gone into poverty as a result of the social security changes the bedroom tax affected eighty thousand families in Scotland about eighty percent of them are adults with a disability how can we and they build a just society when we have policies imposed upon us from Westminster that Scottish MPs voted against that did not have the power to stop so my vision is for a prosperous economy but also for a just society in Scotland mhm mhm well it is interesting in terms o- of the assessing risk erm a major accountancy company just last week published erm a risk assessment erm independence for Scotland came sixth in the list the UK general election was first the in-out referendum promised by the Tory government on the European Union erm in twenty seventeen was second and sixth down the list was erm independence for Scotland now you're quite right to say that the referendum is in September the eighteenth but independence for Scotland will occur in the spring of twenty sixteen and that eighteen months is the negotiating period but one thing we can say with absolute certainty when Scotland comes becomes independent then in every single election we'll get the government that Scotland votes for we can say that with absolute certainty every time Scotland goes into a general election we have the risk of having people we didn't vote for ruling over us that has happenend for more than half of my life I want to change that and have the certainty of democracy but Bernard we'll have had yes-vote in the referendum by then and we'll be negotiating independence for Scotland that's what I'm standing for well well I I c- I can tell you Bernard I can well look okay look in all circumstances Sco- erm Scottish National Party MPs will vote for more powers for Scotland that we're anticipating a yes-vote I noticed that Alistair earlier on said he was stuck with me as First Minister in Scotland didn't vote for me wasn't a surprise to find out Alistair didn't vote for me the the point is Alistair a majority of people in Scotland did vote SNP at the last election and therefore we got an SNP government the difficulty in a general election is the majority of people in Scotland vote against the Tory party they have one MP more pandas in the zoo in Edinburgh than Tory MPs in Scotland but we still get a Tory government that is what is undemocratic about the status quo and what is democratic about an independent Scotland but it's true it's true ? families ? it's not the best of both worlds well we'll keep the pound Alistair because it's our pound as well as England's pound it's logical and desirable to have a a currency union erm because England is Scotland's biggest export market and Scotland is England's second biggest export market so for these reasons it's in the interest of Scotland and the interest of the rest of the United Kingdom erm to have a currency union so we'll keep the pound because it's logical and desirable no this is erm this is Scotland's pound it doesn't belong to George Osborne it doesn't belong to you it's been built up by the people of Scotland over a long period of time now I said it was logical and desirable for both Scotland and the rest of United Kingdom I chose these words carefully because I was quoting you exactly from an interview on Newsnight Scotland on the tenth of January twenty thirteen erm I just happened to brought along a transcript Alistair you were asked first would it be erm r- sensible for Scotland to have a currency union after independence you said of course of course it would be desirable to have a currency union then you said  the big consequences of that later in the interview you were asked even more tellingly do you think a currency union with Scotland would be in the interest of the United Kingdom you replied of course if you have independence or separation of course the currency union is logical no logical and desirable that's what you said last year why have you flipped why have you flipped on it this year A- Alistair Alistair how can how can it how can it be how can it be stupidity on st- ? w- w- I I as I'm good at doing the more something more difficult than contemplating I'm wrong I'm contemplating that you were right last year when you said it was logical and desirable you see I believe I believe I believe that you still think it's logical and desirable that last year was before we were in the campaign period and therefore during the campaign period you George Osborne the unionist parties have to engage employment fear and tell people that something that was logical and desirable last year isn't logical and desirable this year but is that logical and desirable no well I can't Alistair we'll keep the pound because it belongs to Scotland as much as it belongs to England it's our pound as well as your pound even Gordon Brown has said that the George Osborne coming up to Scotland is saying you shall not have other pound it's counterproductive for your campaign so why can't we go back to the Alistair Darling of last year saying it was logical and desirable in the interests of Scotland and in the interest of the rest of the United Kingdom to keep the pound after independence logical and desirable mhm well I pointed out in that interview we have a a fiscal commission report which on page four sets out a range of options for Scotland I'm sure you've read it the fiscal commission has a range of prominent economists a couple of Nobel laureates but I want what's best for Scotland  what's best for Scotland is keeping the pound sterling we should keep the pound sterling because it's good for Scotland and good for the rest of the United Kingdom hm but Alistair you you used to be in favour of the euro you were in favour of ? ? Alistair in two thousand and ? you were in favour of the euro no I'm not in favour of joining the euro no I'm in in favour of keeping the pound sterling coz it's best for Scotland and best for the rest of the United Kingdom mhm no well you're certainly  right Alistair that sterling is an internationally tradable currency nobody can stop you using it but I want what's best for Scotland and for the reasons set out in the fiscal commission working group report keeping the pound is best for Scotland and best for the rest of the United Kingdom that's why we put forward  what's best for Scotland he's right you can't be stopped from using sterling but you're gonna put forward plan A what's best for Scotland but we're gonna use sterling Alistair mh I don't think talking about erm I I don't think talking about the financial markets is your strongest suit Alistair given what happened to the financial markets when you were Chancellor of the Exchequer so the answer is we're going to use the pound sterling in a currency agreement now you know but in a campaign ? you also know ? chance to answer the question answer the question you also know the senior government minister central to negiotiations quoted in the Guardian in March twenty fourteen of course there would be a currency union everything would change in the negotiations if there were a yes-vote now ? aren't you saying in public what your colleagues in the Tory party are saying in private but but Alistair Alistair you used to you used to you used to be erm in favour of the euro you were in favour of it in two thousand and three and you said it was a heavy cost if we didn't join the euro when you were the Scottish Secretary I want to have the pound sterling coz it's in the best interest of Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom that is the best thing and we should start before what's best for Scotland not what's best what is second best for Scotland but Alistair are you disputing are you disputing the Guardian newspaper report a- are you saying the Guardian newspaper made it up there a senior government minister said of course there would be a currency union and went on to quote a Treasury source as saying the reason that they were saying there wouldn't be one is because Alistair was calling the shots in the campaign I think this is a campain tactic last year Alistair thought it was logical and desirable this year he says it wouldn't happen ? ? Alistair no I'm saying I'm saying you were right last year oh a- an end to austerity Alistair you set you set out spending plans for Scotland which show an increase of three percent in public spending as opposed to the one percent that's planned by the Tory party now three percent is not  a a huge ? of an increase but it's an increase to end austerity we have to end austerity and the pressure on the public services while it's worth having control of our own finances is we can do that in an independent Scotland no but that's but Alistair if you'd read if you'd read if if you'd read if you'd read the document Alistair you'd see it predicates a budget deficit of two point four percent to two point two percent over a two year period that can be called a reasonable budget deficit because when you were chancellor of the Exchequer your budget deficit was eleven percent of gross domestic product all of us who live here are proud of Scotland of course we are I want Scotland to prosper we all do but it is not our patriotism that is at stake tonight rather it's something bigger than that and that's the future of our country the future for our children and our grandchildren and it isn't just for politicians it's for all of us and you know there are times that for the love of our family and the love of our country it's sometimes best to say no not because we can't but simply because it is not the best thing to do now in six weeks' time we will make the biggest decision that we've ever made here in Scotland and remember this if we decide to leave there is no going back there's no second chance now for me as a choice is very very clear I want to use the strength of the United Kingdom to make Scotland stronger we can have the best of both worlds with a strong Scottish parliament with full powers over health over education and with more powers guaranteed because a vote to say no thanks to the risks of independence is not a vote for no change now during the course of the evening this evening I will have a chance to ask Alex Salmond questions questions that haven't been answered in the last couple of years and he either can't or he won't answer them if they does that that's not good enough for me and I don't think it'll be good enough for you either because we cannot make this decision on the basis of guesswork fingers crossed or his blind faith it's important that we get make this decision on this on on the answers and facts that we can depend upon I don't I want to see Scotland prosper I don't want to see new barriers new borders new boundaries where none exist I don't want to see anything get in the way of the jobs and security that we need in this country so let's say with confidence let's say with pride let's say with optimism no thanks to the risks of independence and let's say let's have the best of both worlds not just for us but for generations to come well look there's still six weeks to go and the statement of the obvious the only poll that counts is the one that'll take place in six weeks' time what's striking is the polls haven't actually shifted over the last two and a half years this poll is more or less the same as it was when the first poll referendum poll was published in January of two thousand and twelve which suggests that despite everything that's happened in the last two and a half erm years and this is a long long time this must be the long- long- longest campaigns in history not much has changed I'm not complacent we need to go out and win every single vote because I said the stakes couldn't be higher there's no going back if we decide to go well I believe it's possible because as I said we can have the best of both worlds a strong Scottish parliament here in Scotland but in addition to that we have access to a much bigger market there are firms in Scotland who excel erm because of the UK not despite the UK our financial services the creative industries manufacturing they all do well because they've got this unimpeded market and it's different from what happens in Europe doesn't matter whether customers are here in Scotland England Wales erm Northern Ireland that is a massive gain for us and I don't want to see any border or any boundary put in the way of that it is so so important as is the security we get you know we've got we we've got erm many many assets but being part of a bigger country means that when you have a shock to the system or you've got long-term pressure like pensions you've got that security there as well you know I I I don't accept that you know in in in Scotland we have a population that is ageing more quickly than it is in the rest of the United Kingdom now at the moment the costs of that the risks of that if you like fall on the UK as a whole it was John Swinney who said that in that document that we weren't meant to see he said that the risks the costs of meeting erm an ageing population fall on the whole of the UK with independence it would fall on our country alone a country that is very dependent on North Sea oil and as John Swinney himself said that North Sea oil revenue is declining it's notoriously volatile so what I would say and I too want to build a fair and just society it is far better to do that when you've got a stronger bigger economy erm that you that you can build upon and make sure that you are treating older people fairly and when it comes to voting governme- getting governments you didn't vote for I didn't vote for him but I'm stuck with him I just accept that's what happens in a democracy both tax and increased power over housing benefit and income tax income tax the power to to erm to there's two things happening there is power already coming well you've got power on income tax and on top of that you'll have additional power erm to to vary the rate of income tax so yes there are substantial powers responsibility over nearly forty per cent of what the Scottish government spends and I think that is a major step forward what is I say it maintains the fact we have a Scottish parliament but we also have the advantages the opportunities and securities that come from being part the U- United Kingdom and we don't take on a whole bunch of risks that we don't need to take on yup a nice line but it's not a good answer most of us believe that we can have the the best of both worlds we've got a government in Scotland we've also we are part of the eight larger countries to me it's not a foreign country it is a country which I want to play my full part as much as I want to do in Scotland don't drive me ? I I want to start I want to start with the question of the currency because it's important people want to know how much their money will buy what their savings are worth now you said you want a currency union after if we vote for independence which seems to me a bit like getting a divorce and keeping the same joint bank account if you do that you've got to get agreement on the other side us saying no so it won't happen what's plan B yes but the transaction costs you're referring to are imposed because of the costs of independence we sell seventy percent of what we do to England they sell ten percent erm to us but I as- ask you again the pound belongs to the UK not to England not to Scotland not to Wales and not to Northern Ireland it belongs to the United Kingdom the Bank of England stands behind it if we leave the United Kingdom we leave the pound what is your plan B if you don't get a currency union this is most important no you were not no you were not Alex Alex you are you are so predictable you know what you know what I I brought I brought a copy of that I brought a copy of that transcript with me as well because I knew you would quote from this if you look at that transcript you will see that I made it abundantly clear that I agree with Jim ? that its currency union is stupidity on stilts it only works if you have a political union and an economic union which is what we've got today ? it's not I'm going to ask you a question I want you to ask a question because that's you've you got your twelve minutes coming up I want you to do something that will be really difficult I want you to contemplate for just one minute the fact you might be wrong what is plan B what is plan B if you don't get a currency union what is it we're going to have instead please tell us we need to know come on ? you're not doing yourself any favours here you know you really are not ? any- any- any- anyone who actually that's anyone who actually looked at what I said will see that what I the point I was making is a currency union a currency union only works if you've got a political union which is what we've got today now look any eight year-old can tell you the flag of the country the capital of a country and its currency now I presume the flag's the saltire I assume our capital will still be Edinburgh but you can't tell us what currency we'll have what's an eight year-old gonna make of that Alex Alex Alex Alex no wh- c- come on thi- thi- thi- this thi- this this reminds me of when you said you had legal advice that said we'd automatically get back into the European Union and it didn't exist  you're not doing yourself any favours le- let's let's see if we can go at it erm through a process of elimination earlier this year on the television you said you had a range of options if we didn't get the currency union when you were pressed about it you said you had options b c d and e what is option b please tell us so which we've got the pound sterling we have the pound sterling today look you'd I I'm I'm just asking you a fairly straightforward question there were options b c d and e let's go and see if we can do it through a process of elimination  the euro you used to be in favour of that when you used to say sterling was a millstone around Scotland's neck are you in favour of the eur on the conditions you w- ? on the conditions that we'd never met  are you in favour of joining the euro are you in favour of joining the euro right let me have the second one what about a brand new currency Scotland's own currency that's what a lot of your supporters want are you in favour of that so that that leaves us if you don't get a currency union with one option which you have said in a past you'd contemplate and that's using sterling like Panama or Ecuador uses the dollar that would be ruinous for our financial services industry is that your fallback position is that plan B Alex Alex for for but yet Alex we can use the rouble we can use the yen we can use the dollar yes your sterling but you don't have a central bank the Bank of England which would then be in a foreign country where will be setting our interest rates what how could a financial services industry like RBS or Standard Life exist if there was no central bank standing behind it you can't seriously be saying this and remember the financial markets are listening to what you've got to say you can't seriously suggest that Scotland could possibly survive using somebody else's currency hold on just before just let just let no that's for the anonymous one  the one you don't know who he is Alex ? the the only the only way you could get a currency union is if you were be prepared to agree to all the terms and conditions that come from being part of a currency union that's what happens in the Eurozone Portugal has to go along with what Germany wants you would be in a ridiculous situation you'd be selling Scotland short ending up with an economic policy decided not in edinburgh but in London how on earth can you justify that that's not independence I voted against it actually so plan plan B then  is scrabbling around using somebody else's currency that's no independence that's foolishness of the worst order it really is oh for goodness' sake this is ridiculous what ? see your your answer to my question your answer to my question is everybody's wrong except you tha- that is a belief you could take that view now I want to ask you another question about ? I I I would like to ask you a question about public spending now in that document that John Swinney wrote he said that Scotland would have a worse position erm in relation to the rest of the UK in terms of our deficit the Institute of Fiscal Studies has said that we have a six billion pound black hole over and above anything that austerity imposes my question to you is this why on earth take on those risks when it's good and six billion pounds is about half what we spend on the health service more than we spend on schools why are we taking on that risk which would damage the public services in this country which we want to see flourish which we want to do s- so well what possible justification can there be for taking on that risk you wouldn't be ending austerity but you Alex Alex do you not accept that if you went int- if you went into a currency union which has rules in relation to how much you can borrow there's no way they'd let you borrow billions and billion pound pounds more it doesn't happen in the Eurozone it wouldn't happen here so there's no way that you could escape that you'd be bound into the very economic policy you say you don't want this really is stupidity on stilts it really is it's not ? it's a work of fantasy it's it's it's it's a work it's a work of fantasy Better Together and being part of the union the European Union when the next election may well be a UK lead with a Tory government how does that suit Scotland Scotland wants to stay in the E- EU the powers they speak of are just shuffling money the biggest part of the money will still be under the control of the Treasury there's no new powers Mister Darling you said that erm Scotland is not a foreign country have you ever tried to pay a London taxi-driver with a Scottish twenty pound note erm I'd like to know erm Mister Salmond talks about ending food banks erm but I'd like to know how that's gonna be achieved is it is it by encouraging people who can make a contribution to make a contribution or is it just gonna be by raising taxes and handing them ? out in benefits thanks Bernard we're now joined by STV's political correspondent Claire Stewart and the political editor of Radio Clyde and Radio Forth Colin Mackay a lively opening player what did you take from it Colin very briefly erm Colin what do you expect in the second part mhm Claire they're just warming up okay we'll see what happens in the second part thank you both time now for a short break when we return Alistair Daling and Alex Salmond will cross-examine each other I think if you pl- playing referendum bingo tonight you're probably quite drunk already there's no real new lines in any of this it's a lot of lines of both men a lot of sound bites we've heard before but that's not what tonight's about about getting new information it's about getting the two competing visions and I think it's compelling erm viewing because they're both so passionate about what they're talking about I think Alistair Darling has been apparently advised to ? for Britain by some commentators and I think apparently Alexander just had happiness guru advising on how to stay positive that's not their instinct neither of these men that's not their instinct they both wanna go in for killer blows it'll be keeping ? oh it is I don't think we're gonna get any new information tonight I don't think that was what tonight's about what tonight is ab- abou- is about kick-start on the whole final stage of the campaign what they're both trying to do there is they're trying to get in touch with the the undecided voters the other ones who'll actually still to make up their minds and still could determine the outcome of the referendum the eighteenth of September but it's feisty stuff the audience and Bernard are probably getting the biggest rounds of applause though  I think in the second part what you'll see there is that the the the games are over the gloves are coming off it's a square go in the second part when they cross-examine each other and that's what that's what we're looking forward to coz I'm not expecting a killer blow here  but I think that's when we'll see somebody potentially making a mistake
