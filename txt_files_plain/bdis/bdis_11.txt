our submission erm goes through that basket of taxes and and makes our position clear on on on each of them erm so for example on VAT then the assignation of VAT erm is about as far as we understand you can go erm and so we we make that point corporation tax keep it as it is erm and maintain the erm the integrity of the single market in that sense and it goes through a range of those those different taxes and we also introduce erm some other ideas about specific taxes or tax incentives erm which could be erm considered erm all against the backdrop of erm the the the powers for the purpose argument and a erm in terms of where we're at with the Scottish economy and and what the structural failings of the Scottish economy and what have they been over the past thirty forty fifty years against the backdrop of erm UK centralisation you know people have characterised that as the most centralised democratic state in the world erm and and we made that point in in in fact before I was born the CDI was making that point erm and we we make reference to that in in our submission and so looking at those the key structural failings erm and weaknesses of the economy lack of innovation erm lack of productivity and lack of internationalisation and that's the purpose to which we want to attach those ? they have been structural failings of the economy throughout those decades erm and so it is appropriate to talk about them and the impact that your erm your report will have erm on on those specifics and so one or two of the examples which we erm which we raised in terms of oil and gas erm some of our oil and gas erm members and I'm sure erm Mike was was i- involved in in these discussions erm make the point that if you look at the north east and the economy of the north east erm and the amount of tax revenue which the UK treasury gets from the north east erm which is not insubstantial then there must be a mechanism by which you can improve the stickability of some of that money into the north east infrastructure and in particular erm if you are wanting to tackle those issues about innovation and productivity and internationalisation then being able to use some of that money on infrastructure to move people around to supplement the jobs market erm and erm whether that's from erm modern apprentice level right through to graduate level and and beyond then you need to link up and wait in the catchment area of the jobs market in the north east and sweep in more of Scotland by sorting out some of the erm transport infrastructure one mechanism we've suggested and to do that erm is for oil and gas sector to have tax incentives and to help fund some of that infrastructure erm and so to put in place mechanisms which would make that an attractive proposition so you can link up the national economy which sits off the coast and the local the regional economy which sits very much in the city centre erm in and around Aberdeen erm that aspect hasn't been correct if that same approach was taken to different parts of the economy recognising the differentiated nature of the economy across the country then individual tax incentives or or variance in tax or devolution of tax and it would certainly be applicable thanks very much Ross Mary Taylor from very much erm John Downie SCVO thank you very much erm yes I I think there are two points I'd like to make I one one is around erm welfare and the interface between welfare and taxation erm I will come on to welfare so I just leave that to the side for the moment but but the the the crucial issue there is that erm there there is an interface so if you want to take the social security powers and that's the apposition that we've argued erm then the tax powers have to the income tax powers have to come alongside it so that you can you can make the interface work erm and so that you can erm go back to the second point I wanted to make which is about responsibility which requires we we arrived at this principle through a  process of dialogue with our members in the course of October erm and and it took us to the principle and I I can just read it out to you that it requires the responsibility re- responsibility requires the consequences of decisions to be borne by the decision-makers rather than impacting on areas devolved or reserved to other jurisdictions and that relates to how you fund social security rather than erm the the in- the operational interface for people in both paying tax and in receipt of benefits erm so I I think those are both reasons f- for us why income tax erm needs to be part of erm erm of of what is erm devolved Scotland thanks Richard you know our ? point is obviously  about you know government all levels must be physically a- accountable by us I think taking up Mary's point about income tax income tax on its own erm just devolving that wouldn't work because I that's why we ve- very strongly stated th- e- we must think about a portfolio of taxes because we are talking here about the intricate interconnected nature of powers policies and the taxation system is is a good example of that whether it hits in a whole range of different areas and so I think that's where we need to look at so we're not placing a disproportionate burden o- on certain parts of the the tax system or the tax tax basis well coz redistribution is actually more difficult in Scotland with taxes because we don't have the big differentials perhaps we have in the south east between erm earnings and wages and you know we've looked at this we've got the figures but being a bit specific as as Michael said you know if you look at charity tax you know we have a you know a lot of information in that and and and we've got a couple of pages in the submission and what see here is I think com-  if erm income tax is devolved then we need to think about the consequences of that in terms of charities for example so we need tax relieves over charitable donations and this includes as as Fraser was talking about social investment gift aid inheritance tax relief coz it's a natural kno- knock-on consequence if you want your do you want to have consistency now if these were devolved in Scotland we could actually design you know a much better system of you know charity tax relief that that would actually as Ross said a bit for the private sector would act as an incentive for charitable giving and actually for third-sector organisations as well and we touched on for example in our submission on the devolution of erm VAT relief for charities there's some technical issues around that would make it much easier for organisations to claim as well so they aren't very technical points they are there
