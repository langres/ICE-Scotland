well earlier I was joined by Lizzy Dunn a teacher at a primary school in Glasgow and the best-selling children's author Cathy MacPhail thank you both for joining us this evening at Lizzy or should I say Mary Poppins lots of children look like they really bought into World Book Day today had lots of fun and erm what what have you what's actually been happening up and down the country in schools and the children were asked to dress up as their favourite character and lots of people have actually been sending erm send you some pictures of their children dressed up erm as their favourite erm characters erm Cathy why do you think it's so important to have a a a a day dedicated to children's literature erm Lizzy you teach erm P three and P four children and obviously today is a special day but I mean how regularly do your pupils read you know outside of school erm Cathy d'you think it matters what they read just as long as they're reading and d- do children read as much as they used to iPods tell me about it yeah a- and you seem to be doing erm very well erm lots of children are reading your books and you've won you've won lots of awards and look at this beautiful one here erm the Scottish Ch- Children's Book Awards fantastic so what inspired you to start writing a- erm where'd you get your ideas from wow a- and Lizzy wonderful for the children to hear today from authors like Cathy that must've been inspiring for them and we've got a little bit of time left but what were your favourite childhood books Lizzy what kind of book captured your imagination aha and what what about you Cathy very briefly aha and mine was C S Lewis the Narnia series I was bored and I'm telling you read it about ten times but wonderful and thank you so much both of you for coming on Scotland Today to talk about this thank you yeah it's really incredible I mean it's not every day I dress up like Mary Poppins even though I would quite like to well I mean today in schools there's been authors going into schools to read bits of books to children children experiencing new books that they've maybe never heard of before I mean I know in our school we had a golden time with a story where the children could pick a name of a book and they went to that specific room and heard the book being told by one of our special guests and not only just being read stories to but writing their own stories using their imagination erm your parents coming in to read the stories the management team reading stories you know it was all going on at our school today and I'm sure all schools up and down the country will be the same mhm exactly they love it yes yeah of course mhm well I mean I know a lot of children read every single day but there is the aspect of you know there's video games now but the good thing is that the video games have started to make books of their games to read for instructions for example and again that's still reading erm reading instructions for a game they're still reading every day comics they're still reading you know road signs that you can read so a lot of them are reading every day I know it's it's sight reading basically for some of them you know they read something different every day and that engages them yeah that's exactly what I tell the children mhm mhm oh it was so inspiring I mean some of them never met any authors they didn't think they would ever meet any authors I mean we had an author in who the children just adored you know we brought ? PowerPoint the children were so engaged they learnt so many new things and just to have the experience to have these outer links with with people coming in you know radio show hosts and things they just don't get the chance to do that every day and  that's what made today so special for them erm well my favourite was Matilda by Roald Dahl I couldn't get enough of Matilda I'd read it you know every week if I could I could s- I still read it now still watch the film you know my niece loves erm Matilda and tell her about all my experiences reading it and she's just I mean she's three and she absolutely adores it as well aha yes thank you very much for having us thank you mhm yeah yeah mhm fantastic well I think because we are so keen to encourage children to read for pleasure and World Book Day is about reading for pleasure and there's so many dedicated teachers librarians school librarians who are all trying to help children to do that so I think World Book Day is wonderful I just it's exciting for them getting them all involved you see them reading there yeah it's just a wonderful experience it's fantastic mhm yeah mhm oh I I think it well I think possibly they might read more than they used to I know that they are on all the PlayStations and the you know Xboxes X- and I know but at the same time they're still reading you've only got to look at I mean when I was a young girl they didn't have all these festivals they've got you know like the Wee Write the Aye Write you know all the different book f- wonderful book festivals that we've got and World Book we didn't have that so I would say I think a lot of children read a lot more now there's much more encouragement for children to read no that's that's what I want I know that was just wonderful I've always wanted to write when I was a wee girl I was always making up stories I was always writing stories and I always say what made me really wanna be a writer was reading and I still think that's the best way to learn how to write because you read a book and you want you learn without even thinking about it you are learning how to s- y- you know structure a story you're learning how to begin a story how to create a character how you build a story up to a really exciting ending how did the writer make you laugh made you cry and it's just automatically you are learning just by reading so that was something I always did always wanted to relate to just took me a long time to have the courage to actually believe in myself and think I could be a writer real life everything that happens I mean a- children always ask you and I always say ideas are there they're everywhere and all you've gotta do is train your brain to find them because everyone in my books I know exactly where the idea has come from I mean one of my books Grass it was graffiti on a wall I was coming down the train from Glasgow to Greenock and we pulled in at a station and passed a big red brick wall and on the wall it said Sharky is a grass and someone in the carriage went they should rest in peace after that coz that Sharky is a dead man and right away I thought oh my goodness what if a boy saw a terrible crime and went to the police and said I'll be the eyewitness and the next day he's in that train and it's his name up on that wall and just from that I wrote the book Grass erm my favourite book when I was a wee girl was Little Woman I just loved that oh thank you very much for having us
