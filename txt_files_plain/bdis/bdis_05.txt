we're now joined by Margaret Curran the Shadow Scottish Secretary and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh who will be an SNP candidate at May's General Election erm first of all then Margaret just what's been your experience mhm mhm as a- as an SNP candidate Tasmina have you a similar experience and is it your experience that the the abuse comes because of of your politics or is it this misogynist thing we're hearing about in the report fight with your own yeah mhm is it your experience Margaret that it's politics or erm it's gender that's the issue just in this very basic point I mean in in politics is by its nature rough and tumble and and you can block these people you can ignore them why d- mhm mhm mhm mhm and briefly Tasmina that same point it goes with the territory mhm but those who overstep the mark just block them just ignore them mhm ? okay well well at this point we'll bring in erm from Edinburgh political commentator Andy erm Maciver erm Andy erm is is this the level of our political debate in Scotland do you think is it representative of the wider debate oh oh and and just to exag- erm erm to to to make more of that question do we sometimes erm exaggerate what's happening in social media as as being what's going on anywhere else and that's not really the case Margaret mhm but but but is that not the point that Andy is making there is too little that distinguishes both parties and th- and th- that's why the other the the these other personal elements are are driven mhm mhm but is it part of the wider debate that you feel when you're out there you you were at a meeting tonight is is is what you see on the social network is that reflected in in in your wider meetings when you're out actually meeting people mhm is that part of the wide mhm mhm mhm Andy who who are these people then Andy I mean erm you you s- you give us a suggestion who there might be earlier on erm and y- the the impression given is they're o- they're often anonymous hiding behind erm you you know anonymous names and avatars erm the- they're they seem very angry erm and they also seem very ignom- erm is that too much of a generalisation so very briefly Margaret where does it where does it go from here will it continue do you think mhm mhm and finally on that point Tasmina mhm Tasmina Margaret Andy thank you for joining us oh I think pretty bad but there's a bit of it Facebook put myself up for public office I expect robust debate but sometimes I think it was over the line erm you know what I think the one thing that worries me most are the the number of people who've come to me and said I don't want to go on your Facebook you know and respond in Facebook coz I'm frightened what they'll say to me and I think we scare other people off participating in Facebook and social media that's what worries me but I would say there's sort of two strands in it one there is a sort of you know where there is a bit of you get vitriolic debate just because someone disagrees with your politics and they feel because they disagree with you they can say anything to you when it's very robust you know I've had colleagues say right from the Shadow Cabinet Caroline Flint Chris Bryant people like that who can't believe you know the response they get if I'm tagged into the you know I'm connected into their comments they just are astonished by what's going on in Scotland at that level but there's another strand which I think is of a nastier ilk which is really unacceptable which if your family see it they get upset you know and just people are astonished just at the level of personal abuse and I think that's you know none of us want that but some of us are a bit more you know we're a bit more experienced then and they've been around but it's more it's frightening other people off I think that's what wou- worry me most but you know we just have to take it on and we will I won't let anybody frighten us off this debate mhm it's both I think there is undoubtable a gender dimension to it but I would have to say I do think we need to understand there's a charge in Scotland just now and erm you're absolutely right Tasmina about the energy and the drive that we've had but it can't get into a level of aggression and vitriol that I think it has been erm you know it has been articulated through social media and we do need to temper that a bit mhm mhm yeah I've started blocking some of them out  I no- I tried not to do that in the beginning just as a democratic principle because if people want to say aggressive things you know they can say aggressive things I don't think it's the right way to debate and I think some people erm just don't you know are not terribly you know erm measured in what they say but I st- I started blocking some people because they really have gone beyond the pale as I say I would make a distinction between people who just call you a liar just because they disagree with you you know and that happens far too often and it's too i- too easy an insult and we need a better debate on that I would generally say the- but there is a distinction between that and people who step over that line I think and go into vile personal abuse and you know and that's not they wouldn't even these people wouldn't say this to you in public you know I don't mind if these people would have the courage to actually say this is who I am and I'm prepared to stand by a lot of this I imagine they'd be quite ashamed if their colleagues knew that's what they were saying to people like us mhm in case the culture about about some of the debate we're having I think we need to do that no I think that's far too simplistic I don't agree with that at all erm and I do think we need to sophisticate the level of debate generally of course we should but also particularly in social media if I had one point to make today tonight it would be to say to those ordinary people who use Facebook as a great medium for people to express views and to hold people like us to account robustly do not be frightened off that by the extreme views and the most aggressive intimidating views you have people should get to use it coz erm it's a great you know platform it should u- it's a huge opportunity for people no no I don't think so I oh there's big debates between us I would have to say I think it should be yeah mhm no the point the one where I would say I agree with Andy is where you know y- if you're at social media you will think everybody's horrible and they're not the vast majority of people the vast majority of voters when you're out engage with engaging with them even if they're not voting for you will be perfectly reasonable with you and you know that's a very small minority and very extreme views somehow it's given erm you know people who behave in a very unacceptable way it's given them an oxygen and a platform but they're a very very small minority of people but some people don't like that though they don't like seeing so many ? yeah well it will continue I think but we just have to be assertive and stand up for it but more than anything else we have to create the space not for those people as Andy's properly described them but for ordinary people people who are reasonable and who've got a point to make either pro or against you but they get the space to use social media that's what that needs to be the future in Scotland then we need to change the culture a bit and if you disagree with someone you don't need to do it in such a vitriolic and nasty way indeed absolutely I think it's important to say at the outset though that you know if one wants to be treated with respect one should also treat others with respect erm in a social media forum erm moving on from that do erm also erm I mean I think credit must be given to Women For Indy who started the Send Off Sexism Campaign which Nicola Sturgeon signed up to immediately and and all politicians followed suit absolutely there should be robust debate absolutely politicians should be questioned about their actions and absolutely politicians should be expected and must be truthful and honest in their responses however there comes a point where a line is crossed and you move from what are erm decent professional questions to someone's personal domain erm domain making accusations about them perhaps about their personal lives with no knowledge of them as individuals whatsoever which is extremely disturbing and as a mother of children you know my children also find themselves having to read things about me that are not only untrue but hurtful and I think the big question for Scotland particularly when we're in this renewed atmosphere of increased political engagement we want to be encouraging young women erm and young people into politics we want parliament to represent the diverse society that we are but what message are we sending out if when asking people to enter the political domain they find themselves a subject to such abuse there are people that same the sha- that erm share the same politics in- me as me that are not subject to the same levels of abuse so I think perhaps there is definitely an element of misogyny in all of this and erm this has been revealed in in a number of campaigns as I say Women For Indy just being one of them however erm in saying that I say that absolutely there should be debate it's part of the democracy in which we live but there i- there is a line erm which when crossed erm is most distasteful unacceptable and doesn't take political discourse which can be great in this renewed and refreshed environment any further well indeed it's the point I made you know just a few seconds ago I mean this and this  you know if you're putting yourself forward for politics of course erm you should be questioned and that's absolutely correct erm and a correct course of action oh you you can do that absolutely you can there are mechanisms available erm to us which we all use but I think the important point is let's not find ourselves in a position where we have to react in such a manner why not use this enthusiasm and channel it into great political discussion which we can be having at such an important point in Scotland's constitutional history well I I I I I do- I don't know where Andy's getting his information from there there're robust debates erm erm taking place every day every hour every minute and on that you know erm erm erm on that point social media is an excellent outlet for discussing matters of tremendous importance to the people of Scotland and it gives them erm access erm to information erm and to discuss things with each other erm and then you know well no all all forms of media erm media are important whether it's television whether it's newspapers or whether it's social media and I think what's important is we don't dictate to people erm what media they use to engage erm in democ- in the democratic debate but erm make sure that there is media available for them to do so and that there is a balanced unbiased media too mhm well I would just say that there are some frustrations that the people are very much frustrated particularally with Westminster politics we have opportunities for change now then how our Westminster erm erm government can look i- how the politicians there can look in let's just not talk about women let's talk about other minority ethnic community as well erm who we'd like to see represented erm at all levels so no we have a great opportunity let's channel all this positive energy into good debate and let's deliver for the people of Scotland in this General Election erm no I don't think it is in terms of the mainstream political views I think there's quite a lot of different aspects this debate I think the first thing we have to realise is that a lot of the people who perpetrate this sort of abuse are people who haven't had an outlet maybe ten years ago and have been given an outlet by social media in terms of the misogynist stuff frankly there're people who would've been in their bedroom ten years ago wondering why they don't have a girl-friend and now they're on twitter abusing female politicians so I think that's one aspect to it and it there I mean there's vile disgusting stuff and even nobody can really condone erm what they're doing I'm not convinced it's a a mainstream view I think it's a kind of digital under-class that we have of semi-engaged political people who choose to indulge in this sort of abuse it's not just women though there's abuse of other sectors of society as well you see a lot of online abuse of Jews for instance a lot of online abuse of Catholics online abuse of people of the centre right online abuse o- of of of America and the United States you could go on and on and on with the different sections of people who abuse different sections of society but there is no question there's a misogynist element to  part of it no I don't think it is yeah I think we do there's a a fairly small number of social media users in terms of the whole of population of Scotland I think there's a couple of answers to that question political debate in this country is not good take the social media stuff to one side political debate is pretty poor in this country and it's largely because of what you see on the couch you've got a Labour politician and an SNP politician if you ask them about education health care levels of taxation transport they'll say pretty much the same thing about those issues we don't really have a debate about politics and about ideology in this country and what that does is it drives personalised debate it drives constitutional debate and it's part of the reason why we are in the situation that we're in just now I think it's it's worth looking at a bigger picture here as well we live in a country where the three Holyrood leaders of the three main parties are women the Shadow so- Secretary is a woman the Presiding Officer is a woman it's a very good country for women to do politics it's far removed from what we saw erm in the Westminster system before devolution came erm to us here in Scotland so we've really moved on a hugely erm long distance here in Scotland I think it's a very progressive pa- place for women to do politics in of course absolutely and and no I don't think it is but I think that what we have to understand is that ten years ago these people were were quiet because they didn't really have an outlet like social media it's such an easy thing for people to access and people to use that didn't use to happen before they don't write letters to the editors of newspapers they don't come on television programmes they don't go to Question Time so these are people who have an outlet that they didn't use to have before it's not new to have people who are angry and it's not new to have people who are nasty to other people I think what's new is that they have an outlet where they can do it and they can directly contact somebody like Margaret on her Facebook page and say the terrible things that they have said I think the really positive thing about all this if there is a positive thing about it is that you know if they think somebody like Margaret Curran is gonna go away because they do that to them on Facebook then they probably got another thing  coming and I think that's what they actually you know they they want to force their enemies out of debate and out of politics and I don't think they're having a very good time of doing that quite frankly
