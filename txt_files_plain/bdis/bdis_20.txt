here with us now in the studio is the former head of news and current affairs at both BBC Scotland and STV Blaire Jenkins and the Labour MSP and former BBC producer Ken Macintosh thanks for joining us this evening erm Ken because of the Smith C- the Smith Commission the Scottish government now has erm a consultative role in the BBC charter renewal erm
 is this blueprint for a more enhanced erm BBC Scotland erm a welcome contribution a useful contribution mhm mhm erm i- is it a fair comment to make that this is partly driven by politics I mean where is the demand coming from from the Ken it's long overdue mhm erm Ke- erm but it is this ever going to come to erm fruition because under the latest license fee settlement the BBC's had to contend with seven hundred and fifty million pounds in cuts so erm you know where's this one hundred million going to come from erm Ken does the BBC make Scotland a priority wh- what about the second radio station what would be on that that isn't on Radio Scotland at the moment mhm isn't there scope for more output I mean what what erm they're saying there is it's trying to be all things to all people which is difficult but do you think Scots get a a good deal out of the licence fee okay look look we're coming on that okay okay and we will have to leave it there but Ken MacIntosh and Blaire Jenkins thanks for joining us on Scotland Tonight mhm well there were actually some things that the First Minister said which I would agree with about erm trying to attract  erm more funding to BBC Scotland but I have to say this idea that the Scottish people don't trust the BBC I don't get that at all and I don't understand where the First Minister thinks there's the demand erm for this new channel erm you know I think this is more about a political agenda than it is about audience need or audience demand and that's what worries me erm erm I'm not sure I entirely agree there  again what Blaire didn't mention like and what Nicola Sturgeon also didn't mention was  who pays for this who pays for this channel exactly so the so the so the Tories cut the licence fee by twenty percent and somehow in this twenty percent reduced licence fee we get an extra channel so clearly something's gonna have to give in the BBC so we're either gonna lose you know radio stations or we lose programmes surely the vision for BBC Scotland should be of better programmes made for the whole of the UK not for more Scottish programmes they're not better programmes erm I I think it does and I think that is increasingly done so in the last few years I do think that I would like to see more programmes made in Scotland but there should be more programmes made for the whole of the UK I want to see good quality programmes made here  th- the whole idea this channel I take is gonna be full of just Scottish programmes is it what what's gonna be on this channel exactly if you describe the sort of programmes we'll see mhm that was a digital channel it was a digital channel we agreed to so just to be clarif- we we agreed to a digital channel erm erm I got to agree with Blaire with that the one of the weaknesses of Radio Scotland is exactly that but remember the BBC's far more than BBC Scotland the the BBC is actually watched more by Scots than it is by the rest of peop- on average than by people the re-  across the rest of the UK so it's very popular here in Scotland and what people want is they like the BBC it's a trusted organisation it's trusted to produce quality programmes what I don't think we we want is to have money diverted from these quality programmes and from Radio Four Radio Two and everything else to  an output that there's not a huge demand for I don't just see where this demand is yes I think we do in fact what's interesting is the the subtext a lot of this is erm there was a there's a motion put down in the parliament for example this week from an SNP back bancher which talks ludicrously about the figures that's erm are spent in Scotland it it says thirty seven million pounds are spent on the BBC in Scotland that's  so  inaccurate and it totally discounts the fact that the BBC supplies all the other programmes to Scotland that it supplies to the rest of the UK now you can't discount that you know the fact there's
the Great British Bake Off or Strictly or Eastenders or whatever else it is erm Scots enjoy these programmes every bit as much as anybody else in the UK mhm okay well no the demand is very well established erm my chair at the Scottish broadcasting commision seven years ago who- whose main recommendation was the creation of a new dedicated Scottish TV channel now that recommendation won a all-party support unanimous support in the Scottish parliament because people recognise that it was high time that Scotland had such a service if you look around Europe and we did look right around Europe there isn't a comparable territory to Scotland anywhere in Europe in Western Europe  that doesn't have its own dedicated television channel  so this is long overdue this w- this is not something radical in the sense of being ahead of its time if we get this and I hope we will  this is the BBC catching up with where Scotland is now catching up with devolution mhm that comes from the licence fee that's ? clear mhm ah well yeah mhm but those are not mutually excluded we can do both those things yeah BBC gets three point seven billion from the licence fee when you add on the income the profits from BBC worldwide it's five billion pounds so there's quite a lot of rattle room in there to do a lot of different things this is a question of priorities and what you what you do in any funding allocation is you fund your priorities if the BBC starts making Scotland a priority and starts spending more of the licence fee revenue that's raised in Scotland in Scotland then everything that's been talked about right now is eminently affordable  Scottish television channel erm enhanced radio services proper funding for very overstretched and underressourced  BBC Scotland programmes so this this is a really good package  I hope the BBC will get behind it erm I think erm I think the funding will be there this is about willpower mhm it would be Scottish content I bet content with the full range Ken I mean erm as we said with the channel that the Labour Party and every other party supported seven years ago so entertainment drama history documentaries no it was a television channel ?
 a digital television channel Ken that's what it was erm oh I'm not sure and I don't think in in what I heard the First Minister saying today I mean I think what she seemed to suggest was that there was scope for more output and therefore if you had if you had had two services in Sotland you you could do different things now this has actually been a quite a long running debate within the BBC and and Ken may have  encountered this in the past as well erm there's been a long running debate about you know should you have speech station and and a music station and separate those those two things out so that there's a clearer rem- remit for each at the moment Radio Scotland tries to be everything to everybody erm so I I think that may be what they have in mind but I don't know the detail wasn't really there on that but this is why you need a a a dedicated channel because at the moment with the opt-out-service that BBC Scotland currently has in BBC One and Two the only way you can provide  Scottish programmes is by denying Scottish viewers the chance to see the programmes that are available to the rest of the UK and I think  erm that's been a a constant source of difficulty and tension within the BBC I think erm apart from it the channel what we what we need to know of the BBC Scotland we need a very clear statement of what their rights and responsibilities are up to now erm it's been very unclear within BBC Scotland and I do speak from some experience as to exactly what how much autonomy you had and how much editorial erm control you had over over what you were doing as a programme maker as a department head I think this we need this written down the purposes the remits erm and the accountability within Scotland for BBC Scotland services erm I'm a great supporter of the BBC but we need it to change
