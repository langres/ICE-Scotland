parliament is committed to engagement it is committed to simplifying language but as Ian said there are times when we can't simplify it legislation is probably one example where in this document it's fairly impenetrable but there is no excuse for the documents that surround it erm not being easily understood and read by people erm I'm conscious that we have to report back can we hitting a raw nerve here that you would like to report back on to the full assembly in terms of erm consultation and the language used and the time available is that agreed okay Ian and I both take that point from our separate functions erm erm I could almost put that question back to you because how do we know erm who wants to come back to us how do we make sure we can contact those people that have an interest erm erm we were talking about this yesterday erm a whole bunch of us we have a variety of lists and ways that we we engage with people they're all in relative terms old-fashioned you know we've had a list that we it just grows and people sign up to it and we will send them copies of everything we do we'll send them all the notices we put it on our website but how can we get more up to date and how can we learn who to consult and I think that if we could do that we'd have really cracked something can we ? you hold just a second just a second wow please okay so when it will come to you I think it's a is it sorry is it is it is it more the access to that consultation process erm that aha you see it's yet to just to clarify that that I I must confess I I'm or I'm somewhat new to SOPA and I'm not a member I'm just here representing my organisation but from what I've heard this morning there are a lot of organisations that whi- wish to approach the parliament now there is the petitions committee and all that kind of things so you can do that but if it's a consultation process how would and I make it this fro- the Renfrewshire pensioners' forum how would they know and where to go to and if there's a closing day well I think anybody reasonable would say if that's the closing day and it was yesterday there's no point putting anything in unless that date's gonna be opened up formally again to let them know but it's this how how do you know who you can go to and will your voice to get your voice heard in the first instance ? in general basically I worked as a community worker I worked as a community worker for thirty years and when I started off before I was an activist in community centres and stuff like that and when things would happen you would have it discussed in the community centre last year I got involved in community education recently community education has been downgraded the the ? they have to sit and listen to the community and they listen to what you're saying they asked people if they knew about it they organise to get them to discuss it and to and to show them the route to get them in the door and erm show them the route on how it's important they get involved and I think whe- where the stuff has come through for the referendum the time's right but you've got for example Jordan Hull in Glasgow shutting down its community education mean lecturers are getting paid off where what's happening community development you're saying and consultation is one of the main things you need people who're good there you are erm gonna face but we di- erm erm another turn and often the consultee in a consultation and we challenge them on it I put a straw poll on erm facebook thirty four respondents within twenty four hours and they? yet the council's in the paper saying that is wonderful we've been consulting for for eighteen months we need we need people engage folk that I mean erm I think erm I'm sorry if I offend folk here but my impression of the folk around about a table and some of their folk a lot of folk gre up in a better-off area you know working and middle class and the folk I'm working with I'm nowhere in the scheme and trying to get them to get involved and get their head round the stuff that you're talking about so as if we deempower them so as if we deelect them and they understand how they can claim and they can erm use all the th- erm tools allotments aye it'd be fantastic mean I I I stayed in a scheme where there was a great but a but a grass lot ? about twenty foot- twenty twenty football fields big and as I used to say the council don't cut the grass plough it up and plant tatties and tell the folk to get them when they are ready put sheep on it  get them to lead your sheep but how do you engage folk erm you need folk to plant the ideas on I did community work a while hi good afternoon everybody my name's Parveen ? and I work for the million ? welfare organsi- -at -ation also I work for the comu- community development as well as Two Hearts I Have erm I just wanted to go back to what you were saying about how do we get the people to voice their concerns coz I work for the old elderly over over fifty plus well sixty and seventy and they're a lovely group erm one of the things that I do in NEECAG this is the North East Edinburgh Care Action Group and I hold meetings erm twice a month one's in Leith and one in Portobello and we have a very vibrant members and they really have a lot of things issues and discussions like some of people have discussed here today erm they all well we do evaluations once a year I do and one of the things I find they always ask for an MS- MSP or an MP or a local counsellor which they have had and erm and they manage to get their questions across to the MSP erm well Mark Lazarowicz maybe you may know of the name erm and there's various others as well erm but we never get they never get the outcomes back what what they find is erm they get their concerns they get their issues out there but they never c- get any answers back so that is one of the thi-
