the the way the programme is set up for this afternoon erm erm now allows about ten minutes for question and answer around discussion erm so what I think it might be useful i- is that if you've got any specific questions about the legislation and erm a lot of them I'm gonna pass to Ian Turner to answer who's sitting here erm Ian heads up the bill team in the Scottish government it's their responsibility to assist ministers in taking the bill through parliament erm frankly they've got to answer answer the questions that we ask them here in the parliament so Ian can probably answer a lot more of the background and the policy information about the bill erm and erm Donald can answer any questions about erm what he's been talking about the feedback that erm came from f- from the roadshow so if you like to raise your hand and if you wanna have a question or speak at all just raise your hand say your name there's no need to touch the consoles erm the microphone will come up almost automatically thank you erm perhaps you might like to talk about consultation first of all I'll pick up on gobbledygook if you like Ian mhm can you just give me your name thank you very much anybody else's got a question round about consultation we might as well sit them all up and then answer them your name sorry erm my involvement be erm sorry Ian Wallace of Irvine my my involvement in the elderly forums we get asked continually for our views on documents the documents come through and and for two pages there are hundred or more pages full of erm acronyms you can't understand what they're talking about it's official speak don't understand a word and some of them expect the answer within the week or two weeks or even three weeks or sometimes a month but our organisations a lot of the elderly forums we meet monthly and the time scales that we get to erm to respond to these documents is ridiculous I don't think people erm who are writing some of the stuff acknowledge that I think something has to be done about that and the other thing I would like to erm ask is how can you make sure that when you put this any operation that people don't just pay a lip service to it I find that a lot of time when you're asked to consult or you're asked to come along I suppose they can take ? because while you are writing about for this other people are doing the same things for other things and they haven't worked on local government it's about your aims and objectives and erm performance indicate as I know about take that book so that's me organise another consultation thing four folk turned up I put it on a nice wee glossy document that says I have consulted folk and they don't listen to anybody or before you ? stop the consultation I don't know how you find it but I find official language sometimes really difficult and I were also you know local authority former employee it's so difficult sometimes because the management language changes so much I wonder if you could fen- these things like consultation erm the language could be simplifi- I don't know simplified or just made straight Maureen Roger for erm Fife elderly forum yeah I I think erm m- sorry my name is Rohimi Sharma Joshi Trust Housing Association but also I'm a member of the SOPA erm erm advisor group erm I think i- yeah erm again consultations I I think they people have been consulted particularly older people or different generations have been consulted again and again and erm but then consultation is fine but never then again told what was the outcome of the cons- consultation offer their views and erm erm other thing you said you're you're right about the language used erm the jargon erm the the difficulty and if you're going to consult erm people who you want their views on I think you need to simplify it and make it shorter as a summary version of it and the issues of it you know they will erm relate they relate to more about you know having a bill is a legislative SOPA paper how as a per- person who really doesn't get involved in this erm area sh- erm is expected to erm really erm erm erm particular coz erm you know give us their feedback on this I think some s- somehow it's been really puts a barrier to consultation rather than encouraging consultations erm and another thing is erm also the people who are not g- very good at putting their views on the paper or erm across how those are in- getting erm you know erm SOPA made into erm made it easier for them to get involved and express their views and it shouldn't be really put in writing deadlines as if you have nothing else to do you sit there waiting for consultation paper to come around and then erm you know as you can put a lot of  views on it I think it has to change how we consult I think it has to be simplified and we focus on the people who are really a- a- a- you know affected most if I can pick pick m- sorry my name is erm John ? and I'm a representative of the senior students' association at Strathclyde University in Glasgow I'd like to pick up on what the two ladies said about the use of jargon because we saw examples of that this morning both from the floor and from the rostrum and I'll quite happily admit that I didn't know what TTIP or TTP was and over lunch over lunch I'd asked a few people and some folks said we were gonna google it but I think I think that that's endemic about what you're saying that if we're doing that at a forum or if that crime if I can express it in that very male dramatic way is being committed this morning on both sides of the house so to speak well how are we gonna get it resolved if nothing else tell me what TTIP stands for I'm glad I asked Sam Gibson erm you and I I think you find that we didn't explain the jargon so as we didn't have to give a lecture to the minister when we were asking the question it was fully explained that it would erm lead to erm the enhancement of the power of gl- TTIP would enhance the power of global corporations and lead to increased privatisation in the health service Transatlantic Trade erm erm and Industrial Partnership United the United States and Europe erm tal- talked and negotiated about erm in secret the negotiations all going but public didn't know about it until it was late erm earlier this year yeah
