thanks very much we will return obviously to the whole issue of welfare and and benefits erm later on in discussion Bill Scott erm Inclusion Scotland can I draw you in please thanks Bill erm John Downie from SCVO Ian MacKay from Institute of Directors thank you erm thank you and thanks erm as well from ourselves for the invitation to contribute to today's discussion it's just really a very small point and I was erm really backing up what Margaret said that erm the DWP are obviously a UK-wide department erm the office for disability issues is based within the DWP erm a fund was started up by the office for disability issues called erm Disabled People People's User-Led Organisation Fund erm and for the first year of its existence it was only open to organisations in England and Wales it was only when we raised the fact that Scottish disabled people's organisations were not being allowed to access this fund that that was actually changed and this is I think this is one of the the problems that that remains for UK-wide departments they begin to think that you the territory isn't doesn't include Scotland or Northern Ireland you and erm and therefore it it's not I don't I don't think it was anything deliberate in our exclusion from that fund I think it was you know an error of where the remit fell and erm you once they were reminded that the remit actually didn't include Scotland they opened up the fund but you know for a year erm Scottish organsiations couldn't get access to that fund there is a similar sort o- erm issue around access to elected office fund erm where again disabled people who are trying to become political candidates local government Westminster are supported from that fund in England and Wales erm but not in Scotland erm erm sorry erm if they're going to be local government or Holyrood in Scotland are not supported if they're going to Westminster yeah but you again it's a bit of disjunction there erm I'm not really sure why it's it's felt that Holyrood shouldn't be included in in in that fund erm you when the the the purpose is to get more disabled people into positions where they can influence policy thanks Richard I think in in some sense it's we need take a step back here I mean it's easy to congratulate ourselves that erm with the turnout and the referendum and the engagement that you know our democracy is in a healthy position well frankly it isn't coz only fifty percent of people voted in the last Scottish parliament election I mean last year in terms of a number of by-elections at local government level we had less than twenty percent of people enganging in the process so when I actually ask some fundamental questions which I accept are perhaps erm  with the remit of the Smith Commission which we need to be considering and and and that's why I think in our submission we lay down you know governance and democracy issues as a lead-up to this because actually the issues that Marc and erm Margaret have have talked about you need to think about where is the appropriate level of power that you know it should be held in Scotland and I'm thinking about it's not just the issue of giving more powers to the Scottish parliament what we're talking about in terms of local government and there is a debate about the role of local government in the future there's actually how do we get more powers to people in communities because and the fact is you know we can look at the figures in poverty and inequality in Scotland and we know part of that answer is giving people much more say over their own lives and control now how we do that I accept is a very difficult and there's there's no perfect model but I think we need to take a step back and think about the governments of our country I know erm if I take the Labour point of view it's the the double devolution we we need to think about where all the powers we're talking about sh- should lie best to actually do it and I think you know we can get caught up on the powers and how they work together but actually and Adam you mentioned that there's a there's a big culture issue we need to overcome about how we do things as well I wanted to harden up the point so I think very helpfully Margaret was making because even from our side of the the fence as well most of us on this side of the horseshoe did not wish to become involved in the referendum debate on partisan grounds but we are very keen to have our our voice heard now that we are actually involved in in this part of the discussion and I think it's important that some of the very welcome developments that we saw at that time were continued for example for the first time the treasury establishes an office in Scotland surprisingly when the referendum campaign's taking taking place we had erm government offices erm a House of Lords committees and so on meeting up here had never met here before we had an engagement there that there  from them far less from erm the general public erm that we hadn't seen before we have to retain those and I think it's important that at different periods since this parliament was established erm we have seen both at times when the same party was in command in in both erm Whitehall and Holyrood and when different parties were there a reticence to work together and erm you know more of a a a- an attitude of almost fighting each other for party advantage and from our side of the fence that is unhelpful it is most helpful to us when for example in my area if biz are doing things that are useful for the promotion of good business practices that should be being promoted in Scotland as much as anywhere else and similarly if the Scottish government is doing something it sh- they should seek to dovetail that with the activities that are happening in the UK because that will be for the good of all if that actually takes place and I think that I I suspect that  line which  Margaret was establishing there about the need for these two governments to work together is one that probably all of us on this side would share
