 Humza bad for Scotland okay okay okay we're gonna have to move onto the next one and a reminder you can join in the debate on the STV News Facebook page let's move on to our second question from Ronny Weir with so many major companies now declaring  to migrate their businesses in the case of a yes because of the failure to provide a plan B on currency by the SNP what now is the economic case  for breaking  the union Humza Yousaf Douglas scaremongering erm better answers Humza Douglas Douglas okay erm Humza ? ? Douglas Douglas okay Humza one at a  time one at a time
 quick response Douglas okay okay okay now I warned you this was gonna be fast pace so we're gonna move on to the next question Laureen Alcorn asks  independence is not about flags or anthems independence isn't about Alex Salmond or the SNP independence is about  a really simple idea that nobody is better placed  to make decisions about Scotland than the people of Scotland an independent Scotland would be the fourteenth wealthiest country in the world richer than the UK France and Japan but the problem is currently people don't see that wealth people for example the tens of  thousands that are queueing up for food banks up and down this country the one hundred thousand disabled people who've had their disability welfare cut the pensioners who've worked forty or fifty years and now have a pension that's barely worth the piece of paper it's written on I want the full powers of independence so that we can fight inequality like abolishing the bedroom tax also that we can create jobs so that our  young people don't have to leave Scotland to find opportunity our independence actually to protect our vital public services like the NHS so I hope you vote yes on the eighteenth of September for a better future for us all actually erm the question was absolutely correct erm the the UK government would back a currency union we know that because The Guardian Newspaper reported just that that a UK Government of course would back a currency union erm th- the reason why a Nobel Prize-winning economist the reason why the UK government the reason why even Alistair Darling says that it would be logical and desirable to have a currency union is because it makes sense not just for Scotland but also for the rest of the UK because of the exports and because of the travel and the trade that happens between both countries erm we've laid out a range of other options of course as well using the currency without a formal agreement having our own currency I suppose the question for the No camp is why is it that every other country in the world has managed to find a currency solution but somehow Scotland would be too stupid to have a currency of its own see I I respect Alis- erm Douglas Alexander's view of course to to have a different view to mine on independence tha- that's one erm   neck and neck knife edge here let's say in barely a week's time people vote for independence what currency option will you be advocating for the people of Scotland and for your constituents  should we have no
currency your your your smart  ? ? point well for we've been asking this question of Douglas Alexander for two years  and yet we don't know what option he would advocate erm for his constituents and  for the people of Scotland it would be of course for both governments to come together and it is highly logical and desirable as Alistair Darling said to have a currency union oh well what we've had confirmation in the last few days as if every single business that is spoken out has said that actually it has no intention  of relocating jobs or indeed operations anywhere outside of Scotland erm today we've had the Chief Executive of Wetherspoon's Tim Martin erm that employs three thousand people here in Scotland has seventy bars up and down the country generates sales in excess of a hundred million say that Scotland could of course be a successfull  independent nation and anybody talking it down is in his words talking absolute nonsense despite the scaremongering  that the Prime Minister has tried to orchstrate we know he met chief executives of supermarkets depite that despite throwing the kitchen sink at us people know that Scotland can of course be in a successful independent nation and more I want the powers of independence to make sure that we create jobs here in Scotland so that young people don't have to leave Scotland to find opportunity erm well the uncertainty that exists of course exists for two reasons erm first of all despite two years of requests erm the UK government has not sat down with the Scottish government to discuss sensible currency options we would
 be sitting down with them yesterday if they had agreed to do so and the second reason is just this week quite unbelievably the UK government has said that it has no contingency plans in the event of independence erm that to me seems like an audacious audacious erm move to have made from the UK government we've had heavyweights of  the financial sector like Martin Gilbert the head of  Aberdeen Asset Management we've had Sir Angus Grossart another financial heavyweight saying that of course Scotland that could be an independent successful nation if the No-Campaign's best tactic is to wheel up Westminster politicians wheel out the bankers I'm looking forward to seeing what they're gonna throw us next week Count Dracula maybe Lord Voldemort I don't know but I'm looking forward to seeing the ? our object erm you know you know you know I'll tell you what about John Lewis if you know that's just not correct a number of supermarkets like Tesco for example rubbish Better Together's campaigns that prices would rise if it's John Lewis that have said it of course there will be competition erm if the price of independence is that people have to pay ten pence more for their la- lavender bath salts from John Lewis but I can get rid of food banks here in Scotland I'll take that energy every week that no Tesco have said that prices prices won't rise even though Better even  even though Better Together said that they would Tesco rubbish that all of us want the best for Scotland the question before us on Thursday is what kind of progress do we want to see for our nation as a Labour representative I want to see change more and better jobs a National Health Service able to care for our ageing population pensions that deliver dignity and decency as our population grows older a stronger Scottish Parliament we can do all of these things without the risks the costs the uncertainties of separation there is a better way to build the better nation that we all want to see is to have more decisions taken here in Scotland by Scots backed up by the strength the stability and the security of the United Kingdom that would give us as Scots the best of both worlds it's what most of us want and that's what if we vote no next Thursday we will get the reason I don't support a currency union is I don't think it's in the interest of the people of Scotland it would mean less power not more power for decisions here in Scotland erm the rest of the UK has made clear not just political parties but in opinion poll after opinion poll that they don't regard a mini Eurozone style currency as being in the best interests of the rest of the United Kingdom but speaking as a Scot from here in Scotland I just don't think it makes sense actually I agree with the former Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party who described it as stupidity on stilts the truth is it's up to Alex Salmond to tell us now what his plan B is we know the capital would be Edinburgh we know the flag would be the Saltire but with just days to go until this irreversible vote we don't know what our currency would be no quite the reverse I mean the fact is that in opinion poll after opinion poll if Scotland decides to walk away from the United Kingdom next  Thursday then we're choosing to walk away from the United Kingdom Pound  the Pound isn't owned by Scotland it isn't owned by England  it's a UK currency honestly ? I don't  think there's any particularly strong options  if we go if we go for a separate currency then that will involve billions and billions of Pounds that would be better spent on our schools or on our hospitals our teachers or on our doctors
 just look at the alternatives you could establish a separate currency which Patrick Harvie supports but I don't know actually whether you support you could try and use the Pound without being part of a formal currency union that would devastate the two hundred thousand jobs here in Scotland that are relying on financial services only this week every single Scottish bank has said they will move their registered office to London that's bad for Scotland that's why I don't support it but Humza it's not about me fire the banks also they would move now this is the week when assertions gave way to facts the assertions of the First Minister that everything would be fine and that everybody should believe him gave way to some economic truths we had every major Scottish bank announcing that they would move their corporate erm legal base to England I think that's bad for Edinburgh I think it's bad for Scotland why have they made that decision because they want the UK regulatory system they want the guarantee of the Bank of England behind them they want the sixty four million taxpayers that stand behind the Bank of England what we've heard this week
 is what were previously remote risks suddenly become very real we're talking about jobs we're talking about livelihoods we're talking about Scottish companies and frankly the assertions of Humza or his leader are not adequate we need better answers with just days to go viewers don't need to take my word for it they can look at the previous words of Nicola Sturgeon now the Deputy First Minister of Scotland when she said that corporate headquarters were fundamental to the strength of the Scottish economy if we'd had the avalanche of announcements that we saw yesterday reflective of one opinion poll suggesting that Yes were ahead in this referendum in any other circumstance the Scottish government would have been effectively declaring the end of Scottish banking the truth is what we've seen from these independent financial institutions from Standard Life and all of the Scottish banks is a very real expression of a very real fear that they haven't had their questions answered what what about ? ASDA or J- what about ASDA or John Lewis this is very real and very immediate why are we in a position why are we in a position with just days to go where you can't even tell the people of Scotland what currency we would be using in the days after independence that's just not good enough an economic reality is impinging on your political assertions how would you deal with food banks by making food more expensive Humza answer that question and what about ? I would invite everyone of your viewers to go online to Tesco dot com and compare the prices of  Tesco in Ireland with Northern Ireland the fact is that website shows prices in the South of Ireland that are approximately thirty percent more I don't want my constituents paying that extra cost and I don't want people having to face those extra costs across Scotland
