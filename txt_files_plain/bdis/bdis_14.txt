the music journalist Nicola Meighan and Stuart Braithwaite the guitarist and singer for the Scottish band Mogwai told us what they make of the new service so Nicola is this all about music or is it about money a- and Stuart do you think that people will buy into it they were certainly making a lot about that that this was about art and putting the art before the technology et cetera but h- how how do musicians make money from recordings now through because of streaming services because you must get a pittance from them e- e- so what's the point in do- making recordings then why why not just be a live band a- are you convinced by that Nicola d- do you think it's sustainable and and you do have to pay for TIDAL unlike Spotify it's not it's not ?  and how important Nicola is is erm audio quality you know mp three mp four is it that much difference a- and Stuart wha- what about people still do want physical copies your own band has been particularly successful in in vinyl and and and similar d- people still there is still a demand of of physical copies of music what about the relationship with with record labels erm years ago the big thing was to get a record label and and that's is that less important now and and a lot of the the people involved are talking about exclusive content  erm going on to TIDAL will they be able to do that though if they do have a recording contract a deal with the record company but people would still want to have a record label rather than doing it themselves a- and Nicola where do we go now we we've got Apple oh that's got iTunes already but let's talk about streaming service in the future wh- wh- where is this going to take us do you think and there we'll need to leave it Nicola Stuart thank you both for joining us on Scotland Tonight it's about branding I think what they've done is they've taken a platform which has existed for many years streaming in some shape or form and they have made about their personalities and they have put a spin on it which means that they're selling their identities and they're I guess hoping that people will buy into that as a brand as opposed to the other streaming sites I think what is great about that is and what Stuart is saying is right in that there's a conversation to be had I mean music as it's increasingly intangible as it is in digital form you know there is a real difficulty in trying to I guess reassert the value of music and and discussions like this about streaming do kind of  rebalance that a little bit and there's also the issues of what it actually means to pay for and own music these days so by perhaps putting a bit of more value on it which is what something like erm TIDAL is hoping to do I think it is really helpful in terms of just keeping that and and perhaps not there being that assumption  that because you can't see music i e because it's on the internet that it should be free because it's far from it you do I mean I think that's one of the interesting things about TIDAL it's launching and it's immediately swerving I guess the key criticism of Spotify which is that erm it has this free tier so the headlines about Taylor Swift for example pulling all her erm stuff from Spotify were directly related to the fact that it had that free tier and she didn't think her music should be given away basically for free fair comment erm with TIDAL they don't have that they have a an a premium nineteen ninety nine I think it is erm subscription erm which sells itself on lossless quality so it it claims to have the the greatest kind of quality audio available on streaming sites or there's a nine ninety nine option as as Stuart says one of the key things is that there's no advertising on that so you're paying for the music I think I think and Stuart makes shoot me down for less and I do not in any way want to be erm disrespectful to artists but I think in terms of this lossless argument I think it's a bit of a gimmick I think there's probably an argument that if you don't have lossless audio already perhaps you're not needing it that much the quality the audio quality on the premium erm tier of Spotify for example is really pretty good and working on the premise that most people are gonna be listening to this on their phones erm or on their computers erm the chances are audiophiles are the only ones who'll be really sold on that it's kind of a gimmick to to rise the platform at the moment time will tell but I think what's interesting about Apple is that they really probably will pose a a a competition to Spotify that I don't think TIDAL is really TIDAL's kind of skirting the edges of the streaming market it's targeting the the kind of higher end spending streaming demographic if you like Apple I think are looking to perhaps really revolutionise things they're gonna curate a lot of things as well there's talk of their being the first global erm radio station whether that pans out or not so you're actually looking at something as Stuart says which does what record labels do in many ways in terms of that filter in terms of that curatorial aspect erm the problem with all of these conversations are they're great for major artists I just don't know how you you make that work for smaller artists for smaller labels and for people who are trying to break through none of these options seem to be really helpful for grassroots musicians I think they probably will I mean I tried it out today and erm what I liked was that there was no adverts erm I think that music has been kinda used as a commodity to flog all sorts of things apart from music and they seem to be solely about the music itself yeah well you you barely make anything anything from the streaming services at all the one of their claims is that this is gonna be different so time will tell if if that's the case but erm generally I think most bands certainly around the level that we are erm make most money touring and selling music on tour well the I think that's that's that's one of the one of the issues with the whole streaming things because it's getting to the point where music is free or or almost free and you do wonder what is the point in making recordings but but new music is the thing that everyone thrives on people go to gigs to hear bands' new music so hopefully that's to re- redress the balance somewhat very much so in fact I noticed the other day that Tesco have started selling turntables so I think the erm that's true and erm I th- I think the erm yeah people do still want that but I don't know I don't know if that's still a niche thing and maybe a generational thing I think it's more likely that it'll be things like DJ mixes or interviews or that kind of thing I think that any record company that would give away music to a streaming erm site would need to need to get their head examined to be honest well I've run a record label so you can guess what my answer to that i- that would be but erm  I think record labels are important I think they're im- they're important in curating music and I think they're important for helping bands out quite a lot of bands can can need a wee bit of assistance along the way thank you
