well joining us now is the former Labour Party advisor Paul Sinclair and Michael Tait the former Director of Media at the Scottish Conservatives thank you both very much indeed erm for erm joining us this evening erm first of all let's talk about the overall performance erm Paul what did you think of David Cameron erm Michael what do you think about David Cameron's performance erm they didn't seize the chance what d'you think about the format in general does it work does it work for you Michael yeah yeah well that's what is setting erm Twitter alight tonight erm Andrew Peach says it's not so dramatic as the referendum debates but less argumentative and confrontational that's what you were saying David ? it should have been a longer period of questioning from Paxman that's too comfortable with audience questions Nathan Matthews erm considering it's not Cameron versus Milliband it's pretty pointl- pointless nonsense then being a separa- erm separately interviewed and Alison ? it's feels far too staged I mean Paxman interviews were the the meat of it where was Cameron most put on the ropes d'you think erm what did you think I mean David Cameron seemed to struggle a little bit about where the the the cut the welfare cuts were going to come from he accounted for two billion but he didn't mention the other ten billion didn't he I mean did we learn anything new tonight Ed Milliband was asked about Scotland erm how d'you think he handled that erm just very briefly erm Michael said there if this was a job interview for Prime Minister Ed Milliband failed it what do you think to that okay okay that was surprising and we will have to leave it there gentlemen thank you for joining us this evening ? erm I think he survived well erm a hammering erm he got earlier on he looked quite rocky earlier on when Paxman was you know right at the traps at him I think he survived that I think he then had a much softer time with the audience than erm th- than Ed Milliband had erm but to be perfectly honest I don't think a vote changed tonight I think they both lived up or lived down to expectations I don't think it worked at all I thought it was very strange and I don't understand a- as I understand that Ed Milliband's team won the toss and decided to go second I don't understand that I would have been there first I think the idea that it went erm Paxman audience audience Paxman it w- it it it it it didn't no- not just didn't work it w- it was pretty dull and if people are disappointed that we're not getting more prime ministerial debate I think tonight frankly will confirm why it's quite a good idea we're not getting many prime ministerial debates coz it is just  it just didn't work I think ma- ma- erm I agree that I think he was in huge difficulty when it came to food banks erm when it came to erm zero-hours contracts you know he did live up to looking like out out of touch ? at that point now he survived and got a bit better erm but I think you know basically I think it was both of them they they confirmed everything all the negatives about them erm the Paxman interview confirmed that this guy's a multimillionaire old Etonian who  maybe doesn't really know how people live erm at the same time I don't think Ed erm managed to answer some of the questions about him about how in touch he is and how clear his message is of what he'd actually do if he becomes Prime Minister I think the problem is you're you're not getting detail from either of them and I think this sums up what the next six weeks is gonna be like the polls are very tight this is a very defensive reactio- erm election erm you know both of them I felt tonight just didn't want to make a mistake and you know they they were found wanting when it came to detail ? but I think ? for the selection i- is going to be alike there's gonna be no broad-brush big ideas it's just gonna be hold-on tight and hope that one or the other can go over the line and I th- I think we're in for quite a a disappointing a nervous campaign but quite a disappointing campaign I think not particularly well but but it's a very very difficult one for him to answer because if the SNP are so far ahead as they appear to be it's quite difficult for him to say well I wouldn't treat with them at all but I think his h- his his bigger problem is this now I don't think he struck this balance if there's a problem for the Labour Party the traditional Labour voters are saying actually you're red Tories actually you don't stand for what you used to stand he he's got to reassert himself but by going through and saying yeah we made mistakes in the economy we made mistakes ? we didn't care enough about inequality we didn't care enough about immigration you're kind of confirming to those voters why they shouldn't be voting Labour again and they need there to be something a bit more positive than that you can't just say that you know the last thirteen years of government of which he was a Cabinet Minister a- actually was a bit of a failure and expect people to vote for you again you know he needs to give himself and his predecessors a little bit more credit than he did tonight I think it was a nil-nil draw erm maybe Ed lost some penalties erm I I think one of the things I think that it was difficult erm erm there's so many issues that he could have dealt with beforehand his brother coming up again that was something he should have dealt with years ago yeah some ? Paul there erm i- it was it was it was okay erm the f- the first part of the the programme erm struggled a bit I think on the zero-hour contracts I think that's that's a weak point erm but was much more comfortable with the audience you could see the way he was walking about the th- the stage with th- with erm with body language and I think to be honest the audience missed ? really erm in order to I think erm I think someone tweeted that you know th- there was a YouTube moment there for for someone to really come out with that a killer question  erm and I think that the audience were far too timid no no unfortunately not erm again the the the whole thing passed by erm in an hour and a half and i- it felt very light and not much substance erm I I think erm I I like to compare them to to some of the referendum debates and I thought you know they they were really lively and feisty and I thought tonight was was quiet erm and I thought ? this is were we ? the end of the ? ? in the same studio ? doing separate things but not actually coming head to head and I think really that's wha- what people want to see really and I think they did everything else but tonight but go head to head mhm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I think tha- that's going to continue to be a ? for the Conservatives erm it it never plays a role in Scotland erm I I I said ? the bedroom tax before erm again you know tha- that's something which which sticks to to the Conservative Party in terms of cu- cutting welfare and he was dancing about that question in terms of where the cut's gonna be et cetera s- so you know th- it leaves it leaves open for speculation fr- from from the opposition parties as to to to where those cuts may be going people may argue well you know you've already cut this you've cut that so you know they're gonna fleece unemployment benefits for two years so what's next so erm he really he d- d- d- did struggle on that one I think if you were saying it was a w- a it was an interview for for for Milliband for for Prime Minister I think he failed tonight erm e- even even towards the end of the question with Paxman there he he was stumbling in terms of saying I will be you know strong Prime Minister and ? of that so I think he was he was un- he was unsure of himself and and anyone with that impression of Milliband will just be confirmed tonight erm about whether he's he's got the the stomach to be Prime Minister erm so I think on that account erm tha- tha- tha- that was confirmed for Milliband in terms of Cameron erm you know he he came across as very statesman-like Prime Minister erm but that was a weak point I think as Paul was saying I don't think we learnt anything new tonight erm and erm erm ? f- f- f- as I f- ? as I say no ? going to be ? next ?
