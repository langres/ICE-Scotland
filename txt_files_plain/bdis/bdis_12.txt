well joining us now are two guests from across the Old Firm divide journalist and Celtic fan Kevin McKenna and the author and playwright Alan Bisset who's a Rangers supporter thank you both very much indeed for joining us this evening looking ahead to Sunday's erm game what are your feelings Alan you first of all have you m- have you missed it Kevin in that you missed that knot in the stomach mhm a- and you see this as th- as the as the fixture it once was coz I know that some Celtic fans don't see it as the Old Firm anymore we saw in Peter's report you know that advert they took out mhm i- as you say it runs through the generations that plays big within Scottish culture is that a good thing or a bad thing Alan dark stuff does that take away from from th- its importance or its value mhm well erm not everyone watching tonight erm supports the Old Firm as an Old Firm fan erm we asked online what the Old Firm meant to people we got lots of replies can't read out a lot of them but we got some brief ones let's erm look at them erm it means violence and cost erm another one bigotry and hatred erm another one it's a tribal rivalry that belongs in the Dark Ages some positive responses though erm Jamie Murray says I'm looking forward to work on Monday with Old-Firm-supporting colleagues no hatred but plenty of good good-natured banter that's what ? Berson said and ? as well it's a lot of baggage that comes with it isn't it mhm what about the bigotry erm do you understand erm Kevin why so many erm non-Old Firm supporters erm hate the Old Firm where does it come from then ? wicked I can see ? going mad at me saying that would would you agree with that do you think that's quite healthy then that it's allowed other teams to progress okay okay we've got thirty seconds erm left and I've gotta ask you what's the prediction Kevin erm Alan thinks it's gonna be one nil Rangers what do you think very very briefly Alan very briefly oh we'll have to wait and see and erm enjoy the game and thank you both very much indeed for coming on Scotland Tonight  I'm pretty excited I mean it's a big game it's been three years   since erm they've played erm I mean I certainly remember many games between Rangers and Celtic in the past and that feeling of excitement that knot in the stomach you know it sort of erm it takes you over for for that period that built up to you as soon as the final whistle goes you know is th- this sudden release and then the elation if you manage to score and the sort of erm horrible feelings are erm if you if you lose it's erm it's not like any other game I mean if you ask any Rangers or Celtic fan they would they would say the same well it's a bit of  both really because it's certainly what makes the Scottish game unique everybody across the world who even remotely cares about football understands the significance of this fixture everybody's heard of Rangers and Celtic erm and it gives the Scottish game a a drama that it would otherwise lack but there's no denying there's a- an ugly side to it as well erm I mean we both live in Glasgow as much as I'm excited about this game you know I'm not entirely sure I'm looking forward to the aftermath erm I might go out and just kinda shut the door you know there's erm there's no getting away from the fact that there's   there's some pretty dark stuff comes out as well well there is and erm you know erm various things there to consider all of which are true but there is also a certain language between Rangers and Celtic fans you know people who are friends people who work together there's a certain banter that takes place that both sides engage in and get and understand and you know there's there's no real erm hatred when that's taking place it's it's pantomime it's it's theatre and it it's a social lubricant to a certain extent well that's there I mean there's no getting away from that as well  but I don't think it's the case that all Rangers and Celtic supporters care about those issues erm as much as outside observers seem to think they do I think there's a very vocal erm element of each supporter erm who do care very deeply about those things and because they're so vocal that's what the outside world hears though within that there's a lot of come and go between Rangers and Celtic fans well I mean I think that's certainly true but at the same time I can understand people's frustrations if you are a Motherwell fan or a Falkirk fan you know why don't people who live in Motherwell Falkirk support the local team you know I grew up in Falkirk I didn't support Falkirk I supported Rangers because it was cooler and you know that's why erm it brought ? struggle to get people through the door erm and I think erm one thing that maybe could be said about the partial demise of Rangers is that it has opened things up to a certain extent for other teams you know A- Aberdeen fans are now potentially looking at their team winning the league when was the last time we were able to say that you know erm sometimes we do get locked inside the Rangers and Celtic bubble and objectively it might be a better thing for Scottish football if those two teams erm weren't quite as strong well Celtic are going in as favourites and that puts a bit more pressure on them so I think  Rangers will sneak a one nil win thank you hello I have I have erm and I hope they're back in the SPM as quickly as possible I think Celtic had been adversely affected by erm their absence by Rangers' absence I think that any Celtic fan who says otherwise is deluding himself Celtic's Chief Executive Peter Lawwell has already said that the absence of Rangers has cost
 Celtic a lot of money
 and it's not just the games against Rangers themselves it's when it's when you been ? a game at Celtic Park and erm you're not just talking about the game you've just seen but you also want to know how Rangers have got on so there's always that competitive edge I I don't have a problem with erm with Rangers fans  feeling that this is the same club in football we always say that football is a different business from other businesses it's run differently different attitudes the current Rangers supporters are the children erm grandchildren great-grandchildren erm of generations past and their shared memories and what they've handed down erm if you like can almost legitimately form a bridge between Rangers before two thousand and twelve  and after and and therefore I think with that in mind Rangers fans erm erm can reasonably say yeah this is our our  timeline hasn't been broken erm I think a lot of the what happens occasionally after these games we're we're at risk of erm exaggerating it sometimes one Celtic and Rangers have g- each have good erm supports that are ten fifteen twenty times  bigger than any other supports in Scotland and secondly erm a lot of erm a lot of Celtic and Rangers fans come from from some of the poorest most deprived communities not just in Scotland not just in the UK but in Europe and I think you have to if you're looking at any misdemeanours crimes afterwards I think you have to look at erm them within the context of some very erm communities with very challenge- challenging issues and I think it's too easy for people in a sub-middle class media bubble political bubble erm to scorn and deride these mhm not really I'd like to ask some of ? well ? I think some of it is jealousy erm I think also that some of these people well well I think I think a lot of the people erm you know who support the other clubs want to look back in in their own club's histories and look at how many times erm Celtic and Rangers agreed erm to send teams  to play erm their teams to raise money for erm you know a retiring favourite player erm to build a new stand somewhere to get in a new bit of kit over you know ever since the ? you can counting hundreds amount of times Celtic and Rangers and their fans have been asked to fill the coffers of struggling clubs and to give decent pay-offs to their heroes and that's a good thing but I think a lot of fans of the other clubs forget that the Celtic and Rangers and their supporters have helped them a lot in the past well if you look at the last few years Saint Johnstone won the Scottish Cup last year Aberdeen won the League Cup Saint  Mirren have won the League Cup Dundee United erm okay they they won the Scottish Cup in two thousand and ten but Dundee United Aberdeen Saint Johnstone Hamilton Academical Inverness Caledonian Thistle they're not just thriving they're playing very very good football and their their attendances are still quite healthy and Dundee and Wizard Dundee United and Aberdeen in the last couple of weeks finally paid off their debt like li- as usual I would just like Celtic to win I'll be happy with any kind of win- thank you
