well joining us now from Edinburgh is Linda Fabiani from the SNP who was on the commission and here in the studio is one of Labour's representatives on the commission Gregg McClymont and the leader of the Scottish conservatives Ruth Davidson thank you all for joining us this evening eng- Gregg McClymont first of all you were erm on the Smith Commission as I just said up until this week the Labour Party erm had been against devolving all income tax to Holyrood so erm when did you change your mind and why so when did you change your mind was it just the last few days then yes o- all right Gregg's outlined some of the powers there erm how substantial is this package though when large parts of welfare are still reserved to to Westminster minimum wage is still reserved and also the personal tax allowance threshold erm just erm just to to clarify you know why devolve tax rate bands erm and rates but not the threshold okay well all right let's bring L- let's bring Linda let's bring Linda Fabiani in here many people th- believe this is a really substantial package erm Li- erm Linda politicians listen to the demand for more powers this vow has been more than met but Linda you have got more job creating powers why don't you work with that erm to start off with okay right there is not enough there to grow the economy Linda is saying okay but with erm erm are there strict okay let her start okay okay let okay let's l- l- let's move on for that and erm Gregg picking up on the point that Bernard made to Lord Smith how transformational are these powers will the Scottish parliament be able to end austerity Lord Smith said this is a question for politicians so there you go do we now have the powers to end austerity then okay all right okay Ru- Ruth Davidson erm Prime Minister welcomed this report but he said it made the case for English votes for English laws unanswerable erm that's where the unionist consensus ends and th- the Labour party is not in favour of that okay Linda I know you'd know this isn't I know you don't think this goes far enough but do you think it takes you a step closer to independence all right and we'll have to leave it there but thank you all very much indeed for joining us on Scotland Tonight well of course there was a process of negotiation inside the Smith Commission and really the the onus is on all political parties to meet the people of Scotland's expectations a promise had been made to the people of Scotland a vow had been made and today we have delivered on that vow that promise has been kept there was give and take in the negotiations but income tax remains a shared tax across the UK well there's been a process of negotiation over over several weeks and ? had to be discussion and give and take and I mean we are very pleased we have a situation where Scottish parliament will now be a ? house parliament  situation where Scotland will now in the Scottish parliament be raising erm more than half of the revenue which it spends and no- and let's not be let's not underestimate how important it is to transfer power over income tax and the power over significant welfare benefits to Scotland allowing a different approach to be taken in Scotland Linda just said that the work programme is about getting people into work but that's not a job creating programme I'm not sure the public will understand the difference between those two things but more substantially what is the key thing in the economy we live in for getting people into work it's education entirely devolved in Scotland control over Scottish economic development and how devolved is Scotland now with the power over income tax eleven billion pounds of revenue every year now in the hand of the Scottish government that is significant powers in Scotland and that's a good thing yeah I think we have to get some context first the Scottish parliament with the powers that have now been transferred on top of the existing powers is one of the most powerful parliaments of its kind in the world as a devolved legislature within a nation state the Scottish parliament is now more powerful than almost every other equivalent equivalent well I mean let's be clear ending austerity that means r- is a rather a f- Bernard will forgive me a rather nebulous term if Bernard means powers to actually make a significant difference to the economic and social welfare of the Scottish people then absolutely the powers are there take the welfare powers lots of the submissions from civic society and I accept there are civic society groups who would like to see erm further powers the situation now where some of the most vulnerable people in Scotland who depend on support to live a decent life whether that's through getting care whether that's disability or living allowance whether that's attendance allowance that power is now transferred to Scotland and when this government want to take a different approach they can do if they want to create a new benefit they can do and most importantly Rona if they want to spend more money on those benefits they can do mhm mhm well let's look at what is passing over there is an ability to top up any benefit that currently exists if the Scottish government of this stripe or of any other wants to give more they can do that there's a power to create any new benefit in any devolved area that they wish they can do that so if we're talking about the austerity measures that erm Bernard was mentioning earlier you know there is ability to do that there's flexibility there you're devolving housing benefit you're transferring over PIP DLE carer's allowance attendance allowance there's a huge scope here for the Scottish government this is a big bold package well it's the same starting grid across the UK and that's why something like universal credit is the same and something like pensions are the same because you'll remember that just two months ago the people of Scotland voted to stay part of a united kingdom and part of being united is that you have social ties that bind us and that's that but you know if John Swinney does want to have erm erm a low band for lower-paid workers if he wants to have a zero band rate then there is nothing legal here to stop him doing that what I'm interested about is why the SNP are so keen to have power over the starting rate coz it seems to me as if they want to erm put taxes back on the lower-paid workers we've just raised the income tax threshold of the UK from five and a half thousand to twelve thousand I just heard Linda say twice now that this vow is not broken I happened to bring a copy of the vow with me it only runs to seven paragraphs Linda can you tell me what paragraph what line what sentence what word what full stop what comma do you have issue with that wasn't made which one which one did we not meet so essentially you can't can't you can't give me any any paragraph sentence that you don't think was met can I just say I think actually the SNP have misjudged this coz I think they've acted in quite bad grace you know they signed the deal on Monday or sorry on Wednesday and whined about it on Thursday now of course this isn't full independence it was never going to be full independence and you know why not coz the people of Scotland voted against full independence this was a compromise deal it was always going to be a compromise deal we went further than our Strathclyde report Labour went further than their report everybody moved here and this is a massive massive transfer of power and the bad grace do you know a candy sticks in the craw a little bit for Linda mhm sure oh actually the Labour party's been quite erm positive in trying to engage on this William Hague's looking at this down south in how it would work the SNP have already had a a self-denying ordinance they've never voted in in the House of Commons on English-only legislation erm they've chosen to recuse themselves from that for decades erm and I think people understand that if the politicians are in a a legislature if their constituents aren't affected by what's being voted on then then why should they vote on it and polling has shown that in Scotland people understand that but let's be clear this isn't about English votes for UK laws Scottish politicians with things that affect the whole UK the budget shared taxation like income tax Scottish politicians would still be able to vote on well no I I don't agree with that I mean I agree that there are more powers there that has to be welcomed but what we're talking about is less than thirty percent of tax erm raised in Scotland k- you know coming under our powers erm we're talking about less than twenty percent of welfare and you've got to look at the whole package in the round and what we don't have are job creating powers and that that's a really big deal to help grow the economy erm I'm particularly disappointed that we haven't been able to stop the the really bad rule out of universal credit I mean I wanted all of welfare devolved for example I wanted erm further powers n- no we don't we don't have a- this package does not deliver job creating powers what it it delivers the work programme but that's about trying to get people into jobs it's not about actually creating jobs and that doesn't help in grow the economy which then means that you can use that to be fairer so the whole package together has to be looked at yes it's welcome coz it's more powers but I don't feel it's enough to say that the vow was met or indeed that these powers are in any way extensive oh I think they will well let me tell you something Ruth I don't have it sitting in front of me but what I do know is that people were promised extensive and substantial powers and there was over seventeen thousand submissions to the Smith Commission most of the organisations and many many of these that came in wanted devolution of welfare they wanted devolution of work creation and they wanted more control over the economy less than thirty percent of tax and less than twenty percent of welfare expenditure is not extensive to me and I believe it's not extensive to many people just look at what the STUC are already saying well you know first of all the context erm Ruth and Gregg are talking about we have these powers no we don't this has been put to the Westminster parties the onus is now on them to meet the next part of their promises which is to put these powers into legislation that's what they'll have to do of course it doesn't go far enough for us erm and you we heard earlier about compromises being made well nobody compromised more than the SNP and the Greens in coming into this process with good faith and yes we're pleased we will have more powers but no it's certainly not enough for what we want for the future of Scotland
