imagine being eighteen and not just landing your first job in a new city   at a very busy Christmas period but landing your dream job working in the Celtic Store working for a club that you've supported all your life a club whose history and values are close to your heart a job you're excited about you're overwhelmingly passionate about and want to put time into who would have known that this streaming  optimism of the workplace would have been crushed at such a young age I now have a scar on my chin a scar that will remind me for the rest of my life of a zero-hour contract a scar that will remind me forever of the uncertainty of the insecurity of the stress and anxiety of the un- of the impacts not just financial impacts  that comes with a zero-hour contract I was lucky enough  if I got five hours a week at the busiest time of the year despite emphasising to my employer that I had so sa- no exams and my coursework was done by mid-November I so desperately needed hours considering I pay six hundred and thirty two pound a month for shared accommodation which in itself is a national disgrace I got put into so much stress and anxiety because I couldn't budget I couldn't plan ahead I couldn't save I didn't ever know when I was working how long I was working for how much I would be making I couldn't make plans for Christmas in case I was called in this was a job that I felt so passionately about yet I was left uncertain alienated and I had to make choices to survive the scar on my chin is because I took a seizure I took a seizure because of the stress and anxiety that this unstable job was placing upon my life I started taking diet pills and food supplements as a way of saving budgeting and sacrificing eating to pay my rent I suffered an ? eating disorder because that was the only control that I had in my life that same Friday night that I get took into hospital my employer phoned me  at quarter to eleven at night asking if I could work four hours the next day when I said to him I'm actually in hospital ? now getting stitches in my chin the only the only response was okay so you can't work tomorrow I need to know that next day I went in and I showed him that I actually did have stitches in my chin that I did have a black eye and I stood up to him and said that I needed that weekend off I needed that weekend off to rest but that but that came with consequences I was left that full Christmas period and New Year's with no hours no contact  and I got a letter through in mid-January  of redundancy and a thank you for my work I was felt to feel unworthy and uncapable I was made and felt and was felt to be betrayed and unreliable I get cun- erm got punished with my hours being cut I was made to feel look that that I had done something wrong I had felt I felt victimised and was left for that long Christmas period with no communication no hours no income  just pure uncertainty but that's the reality these employers don't take into consideration your life they don't care  that you've got a mental health problem they don't care about the barricades that you have come over to get in this point in the first place they don't care  that you have got rent to pay or no food in the fridge they don't care  about how passionately you feel about this job they don't care that you've had to structure your full life around these small hours they don't care how you're getting home after that late shift they don't care  that this job could have be the only source of income that you have they don't care that you feel victimised or discriminated or exploited or bullied all these employers care about is profit the problem with our nation is not that we're not wealthy enough to provide sustainable well-paid jobs and hours in fact we're one of the most richest countries in the world the biggest problem and most damaging problem with our nation and economy is greed I'm not just the economic future of this country I'm the currently affected I'm living amongst a generation who are being exploited like never before who live amongst economic and job insecurity but it's platforms like this where we are g- actually given the opportunity to vocalise and to be listened to that gives me hope I wouldn't have ever known that these practices were wrong if I wasn't an active member of the trade union movement which is worrying considering the amount of young people in work  who are not  in a trade union we can ensure that young people have economic stability do have jobs that pay good wages and provide sustainable hours and allow us to live not just get by regardless of our age but this can only be done if the old the young the in-work and the out-of-work stand as a collective force decent work is  a human right and it's now more than ever that our young workers need a voice in parliament to end zero-hour contracts and as a united movement fight to end precarious work once and for all
