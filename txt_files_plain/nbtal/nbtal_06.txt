thank you Vice Principal for these erm very kind remarks colleagues fellow staff students past and present friends family it's a it's a scary honour to be standing here before you I know however that I would not be here but for the help given to me by loads of people many of whom are in this room none more so than Dad and Mary who are with us here tonight I genuinely want to thank all of you for being here this evening it's greatly appreciated indeed I only hope you're still clapping at the end of this talk I'm deeply conscious that sport has deep and wide roots in the university sport rooted in Edinburgh but influencing the world this picture shows nineteen twenty four Olympic gold medallist Eric Liddell being carried by students I'm equally aware therefore that there are many more able athletes than I have who have sat on chairs at Edinburgh University however I'm really grateful and if not somewhat humbled to be the first chair of sport at Edinburgh so I also want to thank Edinburgh University I consider myself incredibly lucky to've been able to build a career through sport not just sport but mainly sport it's a fantastic area to work in as many of you know because it can reach out to so many people because it can take you really interesting places areas of discovery because it can open doors for people communities universities and much more I did not reach the sporting heights of my parents in terms of holding Scottish national records or captain in their country but I learned a lot through sport that is relevant in academia as it was for me on the football field I learned to trust my own intuition lead teams develop strategy help teams reach their potential and support individuals it also taught me never to write anybody off I hope that I carried this with me to the various teams departments research centres on portfolios I've led in different universities I've also been fortunate to see sport do many great things and maybe not so many great things as well in different parts of the world so let me nail my colours firmly to the mast I'm all for sport I'm all for universities but I'm also for both of them leading in the societies of which they are part of so I'm really really excited at the prospect of what we can achieve  together tonight I'm hoping to persuade you that sport is more than just a game having spent quite a bit of today talking about David Moyes and share prices at Manchester United in one sense sport is more than just a game but that's not really what I'm talking about tonight I believe that sport can be a positive force I will set out some of the basic principles in sport and how it can underpin national life how it impacted on the emergence of South Africa from the Apartheid era and how it strengthens communities from Dingwall to the wilds of Tighnabruaich  from Perth to Dundee who both have teams in cup finals from Mumbai to Nairobi and beyond making the art of the possible possible making sports policy sports investment sports research sport advocacy commitment alignment and the power of universities working for people places and communities what do I mean by this it would be easy to give you example after example of athletes who've used their wealth gained through sport to help others women athletes from Mozambique and Kenya have done this Maria Mutola and Kenyan women athletes have done a couple of studies recently being very lucky to work with a very talented researcher from Oxford and we've recently published two studies on Kenyan women runners but Maria Mutola first of all you'll recognise her there with Kelly Holmes former Olympic athlete former women's eight hundred metre Olympic champion from Mozambique in one year she won one million US dollars from athletics but she regularly sent money home to fund scholarships equipment for farms medicine and much more athletics for Maria was more than just a game it was a means to an end but not just for her Kenyan women runners if you look at the twenty ten figures here   when Kenyan wo- and this is just prize money not sponsorship money or anything like that Kenyan women runners won something like three million US dollars in twenty ten in a world where many question the impact of athletes as role models the broader impact of some Kenyan women runners is impressive local women selling vegetables each day in the marketplace in Iten when asked whether female runners were making a difference they went so far  as to link success in business as happening  quote through them women runners who struggle to get that recognition in running they run and they struggle for that so it also motivated us if they could get that freedom to do what they wanted why not us because Pamela came from a poor background she inspired me Pamela Jelimo eight hundred metre Olympic champion from Kenya according to one woman female athletes help Iten to grow more building schools churches piping water to these places and helping the needy people in society to pay for fees and much more it is worth remembering the difference that some just some erm but it's worth remembering the difference that some athletes make in the lives of those less fortunate than themselves and for those who question legacies what a legacy that is sport is more than just a game sport can be a resource of hope some people in this room may remember the work of the Welsh writer Raymond Williams who wrote a book called Resources of Hope and championed the need for commitment he argued artists writers academics had to balance their freedoms with the duty  to strive  to help others what he called the art of the possible sport can make the art of the possible possible in so many ways and we should exploit it  to the full sport everyone seems to have an opinion on sport and in some senses that may be its strength it connects with people in so many ways whether you love it or hate it it connects sport divides any discussion on sport should acknowledge both its value but also its uglier more controversial s- side grand claims can be made President Clinton once said football has done more for world poverty than almost anything else sport detractors will have another point of view however whene- whatever the tension sport also unites and illuminates in many ways Louise Frechette the Canadian diplomat the public servant and UN Deputy Secretary-General for eight years asserted the power of sport is far more than it just being symbolic you can p- promote communication help heal divisions between people communities and entire nations and be the engines of growth and of course you would expect her to say you can advocate a strong and effective United Nations but what is the power of sport question me- mark maybe I should have put that question mark at the title of this lecture sport sport more than just a game  I thought about that and decided to take the question mark away because I want to accentuate the positive aspects of sport which I believe in but not in an idealistic utopian way why does it enjoy popular appeal when researchers have tried to answer that question they have suggested  sport has its own language an appeal a vocabulary that extends around the world sport's popularity makes it an enabler sport provides for many people an engrossing pleasurable adventure of self-discovery and expression politicians and commentators enjoy it its imagery its people its ideologies to illuminate the uncertainties and challenges of everyday life sport can mobilise powerful currents of popular opinion Mandela got it in one of his many statements he said quote that sport reaches areas far beyond any sphere of political influence and has probably done more to unify nations than any political leader has ever been capable of you may not agree with Mandela I'm not sure I do but FIFA claim that almost half of the global population tuned into TV coverage for the twenty ten World Cup in South Africa sport provides moments of collective experience and affirmation of membership in a community when national teams and individuals take on the rest of the world run or play in major finals everyone with an interest in sport and many more will watch people places and communities want to make a connection why do so many people want to touch the Commonwealth Baton  or the Olympic torch and why watch the Olympic ceremony or even the event itself analysts will tell you it is because people want to share and be part of an experience that has drawn interest and participation from around the world that draws so many people to the opening ceremonies viewing figures bring home the possibilities of sport how can it encourage friendly forms of communication and help to ease international relations three point five billion people tuned in to the two thousand and eight Beijing Olympic Games one billion people watched the opening ceremony three point six billion people from two hundred and twenty countries tuned in to the London Olympic Games sport can influence civic and civil engagement help with social cohesion and be a resource of hope that alone is worth harnessing and encouraging it can also be a symbol of national and international capability and world standing for those of you who are sceptical about sport-based crime prevention programmes for example Hartmann and Depro's two thousand and six study of the impact of Midnight Basketball leagues in thirty US inner cities concluded that we should not be so quick to dismiss community level effects of sport-based crime prevention programmes such as Midnight Basketball they might appear on the face of it to be to be rather limited in scope and design let's move on I will get on to Scottish sport but I want to start somewhere else I want to reflect upon South African sport primarily because it allows me to illustrate a number of issues about the proposition that I'm putting to you tonight that sport is more than just a game the body of research on South African sport is well-developed and as a young academic many many many moons ago it was where I started to think about sport being more than just a game I first wrote Class Race and Sport in South Africa's Political Economy at the height of the anti-Apartheid struggle I was chuffed when the publisher asked if I would like to reissue it with a tribute to Nelson Mandela and it was published again a few weeks ago South African sport allows us to connect with a number of interesting areas and a number of issues the impact of major sporting events the impact of sporting interventions and the much-talked about L word legacies the role of sport in building human and economic capabilities it was used to put pressure on the government during the Apartheid years later it was pivotal during the process of reconciliation and nation building and as I said earlier Mandela recognised more than most the opportunities that sport presented he knew the language of sport and more than that  he knew how to use it he knew how to harness it he recognised opportunities and he took them he talked of sport in a way that few people do he said that sport has the power to change the world to unite people in a way  that little else does it speaks to youth in a language they understand it can create hope when once there was only despair and as we know Mandela used much of his time in prison to prepare for the future for him and others in Robben Island sport had a part to play for many of men and women football is more than a game I won't say too much about being a life-long Motherwell supporter I'll just say that some Saturdays are not complete without a trip to Fir Park with my almost ninety-year-old dad but as far as I know at least he hasn't told me he was never a political prisoner for the political prisoners on Robben Island the future leadership of South Africa football attained some iconic status and became a unifying symbol of resistance they formed an association the prisoners formed an association called the Makana Football Association football in that prison united people of strongly-held differing opinions it alleviated depression and helped prepare for life beyond prison fourteen hundred prisoners of differing political opinions organised in an A-club football league played with strict ad- adherence to FIFA rules complete with referees and a disciplinary committee to coincide with the World Cup and Mandela's birthday FIFA officially made the Makana Football Association an honorary member it was the first time ever that the ruling body of world football had conferred membership on an organisation rather than a country or an individual in the FIFA documentary Ninety Minutes Mandela said the game made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in listen to prisoner four nine three six three all that organisation meant nothing if you didn't have that little round thing rolling around on the ground every week listen to prisoner five oh five six three the maxim amongst us was that the struggle is outside you have to come off the island much better equipped for the future and football helped in December twenty thirteen when Mandela died the world lost a person who fought all his life for justice equality and freedoms many people have written about the contribution that sport has made to post-Apartheid South Africa much of the recent academic work around for example the hosting of the FIFA twenty ten World Cup considers the local and national benefits of hosting major sporting events it is not all positive it supported the idea that major sport sorry Castro's twenty thirteen study of the twenty ten World Cup was positive it supported the idea that major sporting events gave South Africa a prominent role on the world stage prestige  and visibility Durban has announced its intention to bid for the twenty twenty two Commonwealth Games so sport is clearly part of a broader strategy for enhancing South African soft power Castro suggested the sporting events are important foreign policy tools not just a benefit to South Africa but to the whole African continent and indeed the entire international relations system you may remember the many cultural messages that were connected with the twenty ten FIFA World Cup it's Africa's hour  being one of them Cornelson's study was less positive as she charted how protest groups attached themselves to major sporting events evaluation of programmes such as Coaching for Hope which uses sport to create better futures for South African girls and boys highlights continuing high levels of unemployment continuing high levels of violence continuing high levels of poverty as key problems and sport alone will not overcome these but I want to emphasise two points firstly it is the popularity and visibility of such events that is the attraction to campaining groups who attach themselves to such events and secondly the change in South African society and the place of sport is still very much work in progress during the Apartheid era the policy of the African National Congress the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee the South African Council on Sport this was one of no normal sport in an abnormal society it was a policy that called on the rest of the world to boycott the playing of sport with South Africa a policy supported by the Commonwealth heads of government and forged here in Scotland hence its name the Gleneagles Agreement and yet just as Mandela recognised the power of sport to help in dismantling of Apartheid he equally recognised the potential  of sport  to help with reconciliation the promise of sport was captured in the ANC slogan of a better life for all I interviewed the then new South African Minister for Sport in Edinburgh in October nineteen ninety seven he said and I quote that sport in the new South Africa provided the basis for community building economic development and fostering of civic and national pride sport was viewed as being central to unity development reconciliation and nation building we saw how the nineteen ninety five Rugby World Cup in South Africa provided an ideal platform for sport to take centre stage within the politics of nation building when South Africa emerged triumphant Mandela had on the green Springbok jersey and cap to present the winning trophy and embrace Francois Pienaar that Mandela didn't really like rugby was neither here nor there that he recognised the opportunity and the contribution it could make to the reconciliation process was what mattered with that handshake a better life for all will not come through sport something that Pienaar himself has commented upon and recognised recently the current president Jacob Zuma has much work to do he too played for Rangers in the Makana FA when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island sport is not just a game in South Africa it has carried many messages it's been  a resource of hope and it has contribute- to to building human and economic capabilities but it is not  a solution on its own let's move on to sport's role in peace conflict resolution and development there has been a grand swell in a number of international agencies and NGOs who have initiated sport and development programmes of various types in the barrios the favelas and the shinty tow- shinty t- shinty my goodness shanty towns all over the world I'll leave you to debate what I want to call this programmes like Fight for Peace founded by the Edinburgh University Anthropology student Luke Dowdney that uses boxing and Martial Arts combined with education to try to tackle a broad range of issues in some of the toughest inner-city areas such as Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and Newham in London we know from Bruce Kidd's research there were at least a hundred and sixty six organisations listed on the international platform on sport for development maintained by the Swiss Academy for Development interventions such as the Twic Olympics the annual Peace Olympics have been held in Twic count- -ty South Sudan since two thousand are sponsored by some twelve differing international organisations all aimed at encouraging a space for building tolerance breaking down barriers and more these January teams of athletes gather to compete at football volleyball dance athletics tugs of war competitions are full of people like James who was drafted into the army at the age of eleven and in playing sports points out that nothing is normal for us we know from studies evaluating the role of sport in the lives of both refugees and asylum seekers in different parts of the world that sport can help to provide a degree of normality a degree of normality when all around is not normal the Norway Cup has taken place every year since nineteen seventy two and is one of the world's largest football tournaments for children aged twelve to nineteen there've been around thirty thousand participants fifty two nations twelve hundred volunteers in twenty twelve three thousand eight hundred matches across sixty two pitches huge but the aim of the tournament is to create bonds between children and nations and win friends for Norway through sport the Norwegian Minister of International Development talks of the role this project plays in producing internationalism and cooperation between Norway and for example Brazil Kenya Palestine I accept that the world of sport needs to do more nu- be more nuanced in evaluating what works where and under what circumstances but we must not dismiss what sport can do by two thousand and two the UN had created an Inter-Agency Task Force on Sport for Development and Peace it released its report Sport for Development and Peace towards achieving the millenium development goals the report led to the creation of a working group at the two thousand and four Athens Olympic Games and in addition a United Nations Office poorly staffed but at least a dedicated Office to Sport for Development and Peace the report also paved the way for the UN to declare in two thousand and five as the International Year of Sport and Physical Education that year Kofi Annan pointed out that sport was a universal language and in twenty ten he said that sport brings our worlds together in a way few  if any other activity can manage quote it has an almost unmatched role to play in promoting understanding healing wounds mobilising support for social causes and breaking down barriers in the eight years between October two thousand and three and two thousand and eleven the UN General Assembly passed twenty three resolutions advocating a greater role for sport within international development and peacekeeping efforts the sixth of April this year was the official International Day of Sport for Development for Peace when the United Nations General Assembly made the announcement back in August twenty thirteen it encouraged member states to recognise the role of sport in peace building and conflict resolution this is the latest perhaps in a long line of events to acknowledge the way in which states NGOs and others have tried to harness the power of sport to intervene in areas made vulnerable by conflict poverty and inequality using sport to build a better world now has unprecedented social political and cultural momentum unfortunately when an idea develops such widespread momentum the wor- the urge to act sometimes pushes aside the need for critical reflection unreflective evangelism can take over and we know from Kidd and Donnelly's work that there are important principles to be agreed upon before using sport to advance development and peace to be fair Kidd himself when taking on numerous roles such as the chair of the Commonwealth Ministers Advisory Board on Sport or the front person for various Canadian Olympic and Commonwealth bids did more than most to hold governing bodies NGOs the IOC indeed Canadian sport to account others have done this as well in response to all of this Kidd argues for bringing the state back into development and he has championed this perspective in his own work with the Commonwealth I'm delighted that people of the calibre of Bruce Kidd currently interim Vice President at the University of Toronto have agreed to work with us here at Edinburgh as associate member and advisor to Edinburgh sport research I think we have much to learn from places like Canada as they have from us the Universities of Edinburgh and Toronto will sign an agreement in June to work together this is good for Scotland good for sport in related areas good for Edinburgh
