it seems obvious to us that Scotland refers to the Scottish kingdom of old or in potential ind- potentially independent state in the future and the Scots to its inde- inhabitants or its citizens before the thirteenth century however there was no expectation that the kingdom constituted a single country and people instead Scotland could signify all of the landmass north of the Forth or merely the country bounded in the south by the Forth in the north by the Spey and by Drumalban in the west this was also reflected in what the term Scots meant to the kingdom's inhabitants before twelve sixty it seems to have denoted not only the inhabitants of Scotland in its restricted sense but its Gaelic speakers in particular as we will see it was not until the period between about twelve sixty and twelve ninety that the idea of country people and kingdom coincided to form what we can recognise as the beginning of modern Scottish identity it is this first coalescence of ideas of country people and kingdom that I will wish to focus on this evening initially I'll attempt to understand this fundamental change by outlining social economic and institutional causes I will then explore a comparative perspective none of this however will fully meet the challenge of understanding how a sense of country and people could change so radically this is exacerbated by the difficulty of showing that there was a commonly shared idea of Scotland and Scots in the first place and yet if I am to offer a meaningful analysis of the origins of Scottish identity as lived by Scots today it must engage with this as a phenomenon that was embraced by people at large and could be transformed the attempt to address this problem with the resources at a historian's disposal will lead me briefly towards other disciplines but only to return refreshed to engage with the historical material anew the first significant step towards a sense of country and kingdom as one and the same may be detected in charters of the nation where the land or church concerned was said to be f- s- held as freely as anywhere else in the kingdom of Scotland or of the Scots this became frequent from the eleven eighties this is the earliest indication that local lords were beginning to think of the kingdom as a land with common laws and customs it can be argued that this was born of the more unremarkable sorry that this is one the more remarkable unintended consequences of the legal administrative and administrative reforms in England during Henry the second's reign eleven fifty four to eighty nine because the landowning elite were by then part of a single Anglo-Norman society across Britain and northern France they would have been acutely aware of the rapidly growing difference between the Scottish kingdom and the kingdom of England that emerged during Henry the second's reign for example in England the king's courts became accessible to all but the poorest freemen a development that can only have made the exercise of baronial authority more difficult this did not apply to Scotland of course indeed in Scotland baronial power became more entrenched this suggests that the main spur towards beginning to regard the Scottish kingdom as a single country may have been an intensification of royal power not in Scotland but in England this could have bestowed a sense of unity to the Scottish kingdom almost by default simply because the French-speaking landed elite experienced it as a kingdom that was not England a kingdom where local lordly jurisdictions were maintained not diminished there is one example of a member of this Franco-British elite in the early thirteenth century who identified himself as a Scot on a seal so that he could be distinguished from a namesake and close relative in England more generally however the identification of country with kingdom does not appear to have led in a domestic context to the adoption of Scottish identity throughout the kingdom that is by those of the king's subjects who had not hitherto been themselves seen themselves routinely as Scots monks of Melrose in the eastern borders writing in their chronicle in twelve eighteen referred to the south-east and Galloway as in Scotland but even in twelve fifty nine they considered Scots to be different from themselves indeed a people who along with Galwegians behaved beyond the limits of Christian decency and it was not until some time after easter in twel- easter twelve eighty six and before probably May twelve ninety one that they entered material into their chronicle in which they showed themselves willing to identify themselves as Scots this suggests that the idea of the kingdom's inhabitants as a single people seems only to have taken root shortly before the Wars of Independence this unified identity did not however dissolve the distinction between Gaelic-speaking Scots and the ethnically English or anglicised inhabitants of the kingdom this continued in a new form Gaelic speakers north of the Forth instead of being Scots were now Highland Scots a phrase first detectable in an historical work completed in twelve eighty five the monks of Melrose may have become Scots but this does not require that they ceased to be English it depended on context this new kingdom-centric Scottish identity was grounded in obedience to the King of Scots it is conceivable therefore as Steve Boardman has pointed out that people continued to regard themselves as English in the sense that their mother tongue was English and at the same time identified themselves as Scots in Barbour's Brus for example a Scot is defined by allegiance not by language if we locate the beginning of Scotland as we understand it today in the emergence of a sense of kingdom country and people as facets of a single identity in the late thirteenth century then how is this to be explained if we accept the evidence of the chronicle of Melrose for the chronology of this change the key period coincided with significant developments in the lives of those with property and possessions one change was the adoption of a mechanism for reporting the results of local inquests to the king whose clerks retained them in a central archive this was an operation from around twelve sixty the procedures for safeguarding property had for many years been conducted locally on the king's orders now however royal authority was involved explicitly in the outcome as well as at the outsets and in a form that was intended to endure as such those obliged to attend Sheriff Courts including lesser landholders of their own rights or on behalf of greater lords would have witnessed the king acting as guarantor of property in a new more tangible and routine way the most striking change in this period was the increase in economic activity revealed by the amount of money in circulation this grew dramatically between around twelve fifty and around twelve eighty it has been suggested by Nicholas Mayhew that whereas in England the value of coin and ciruclation grows by a little over fifty per cent and in Ireland a little under fifty per cent in Scotland it may have tripled he pointed out that the figures are difficult to pin down the amount for Scotland around twelve fifty could be an underestimate even if this is taken into account though in his view the amount of the time of the recoinage of twelve eighty remains outstanding royal boroughs were the focal point of the money economy the great majority of those involved in trade including smallholders with surplus produce to sell would therefore have had a regular experience of royal authority and become aware of their dependence on it for their livelihoods by this time royal boroughs had also become the nodal points in the administration of justice at a regional level with old provincial assemblies becoming Sheriff Courts or being superseded by them when the economy growth then the increasing importance of boroughs is combined with the inch- with a change in procedure for inquests that has just been mentioned it may be envisaged that those with property and possessions came more and more to identify with royal authority as a key background element in the pattern of their lives perhaps the most important aspect of this as far as the wider adoption of Scottish identity is concerned was that the economic and institutional differences between old Scotland bounded by the Forth Spey and Drumalban and the area south of the Forth had dissolved one explanation for the extraordinary expansion of coin and circulation in Scotland compared with England and Ireland in this period is that the geographical spread of the money economy was greater gathering strength in areas when it had been weak this is suggested by the unprecedented spread of mint across the country from Inverness to Dumfries the same is true for the infrastructure of Sheriff Courts that emerges during the thirteenth century by twelve hundred borough coin and Sheriff were well established in Lothian but in only a few major centres north of the Forth when Alexander the third died in twelve eighty six they were widespread except in the far north and west unfortunately this account to the beginning of modern Scottish identity is basically the sum total of my work up till now focusing particularly on the decades after twelve sixty as the period when it finally took shape depends chiefly on the evidence of the chronicle of Melrose for its chronology it is only because of this chronology that it makes sense to turn to innovations in inquests and the figures for the growth of the money supply for an explanation but how representative is it what is the nature of the supposed connection between incidental references to Scots in the chronicle of Melrose and what Scots meant to smallholders attending Sheriff Courts what to those buying and selling in boroughs where is the connection that we justify using it as a source for a fundamental change in the identity of those in the bustling world outside the monastery I'm very grateful nobody's asked me that question before coz I would have stumbled for an answer but here we are ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna try it now let us go back to scratch and take a closer look at the striking idea that before the thirteenth century Scotland in any language habitually referred to the region between the Forth the Spey and Drumalban was this indeed the way contemporaries understood the term routinely this needs to be answered if we are to grasp the nature of the change which resulted in the emergence of modern Scottish identity a straightforward approach would be to investigate the evidence for forms of governments and social organisations peculiar to Scotland in its most limited sense was the region bounded by the Forth the Spey and Drumalban experienced by contemporaries as a distinct entity the most compelling indication that this region had its own forms of social organisation in the twelfth century is an extant compilation of royal enactments recently brought to life by Alice Taylor these include the size detail in how anyone in possession of disputed goods was to verify their ownership of them Alice Taylor has argued compellingly that this is an enactment of King William probably after eleven eighty six based on an earlier si- assize of David the first eleven twenty four to fifty three in the original assze of David the first following doctor Taylor's analysis it was decreed that anyone dwelling between the Spey and the Forth or between Drumalban and the Forth who was accused of theft had fifteen days to fetch his guarantor for the disputed goods who would show that they were his the guarantor and the disputed goods were to be taken to the place designated by the king for this purpose in the province where the accusation had been made William the first William the Lion extended this so that in a case of guarantor cited from elsewhere in the mainland north of the Forth an extra month was allowed and this was way deep into the west Highlands erm and so on any cases involving people south of the Forth including Galloway were to be resolved at meetings every six weeks at the bridge at Sterling across the Forth it is striking that although it was expected that people could be someone from one part of Scotland proper north of the Forth to another and additional provisions were made fetch guarantors from north or west of Scotland proper despite the distances and hazards involved and no one was expected to cross the Forth beyond Sterling an obvious way to take this further is to examine the earliest extant description of Scotland by one of the king's subjects this is the tract De Situ Albanie th description of Scotland written some time in or between December eleven sixty five and December eleven eighty four this reveals that the term Scotland was not fixed geographically even when restricted to north of the Forth two versions are given of an imagined ancient ? division north of the Forth one excluding Argyll the other including Argyll but not Caithness later ought to being told in passing with Argyll is on the western part of Scotland Scotia we meet the statement that Drumalban is the mountains which divide Scotland from Argyll as far as the southern border is concerned however there is no doubt that this was fixed firmly in the authors' minds as at the Forth it's not simply that he offers no alternative it is that he describes it in astonishingly vivid terms explaining that the Firth of Forth is called Scottewatre because it divides the kingdoms or regna of the Scots and the English by this point Edinburgh of course south of the Forth had been ruled by kings of Scots for two centuries it might be wondered therefore how the author of De Situ Albanie who was plainly a subject to the king of Scots could refer to the Forth in his way and I'll refer to this towards the end the only feature in the definition of Scotland in De Situ Albanie that is shared with David the first's assize on guarantors for disputed goods is the Firth of Forth it is noteworthy that this is referred to so graphically in De Situ Albanie and is also the only boundary in the assize which people were not expected to cross in the pursuit of justice the significance of this border is also vividly apparent in one of the earliest maps of Britain where Scotland north of the Forth is imagined as an island this was despite the fact that the Forth had for centuries ceased to correspond to a political or cultural division and I'll return to this in due course by contrast the only trace in De Situ Albanie of Scotland as only the eastern part of the landmass north of the Forth is in the passing reference to Drumalban as dividing Scotland from Argyll there's no sign of the Spey as one of its limits and this invites the conclusion that the Forth was the only boundary that was universally recognised and that anything else depended at best on context this picture of ambiguity however rests heavily on the evidence of De Situ Albanie a text which may hardly ever have been read it was written as a preface to a collection of Scottish historical material that survives in only one copy as part of a manuscript produced in York about thirteen sixty it would be unsafe to assume without further evidence that the different permutations of Scotland revealed by its author were therefore shared by many people and so we return to the dilemma of how to access the way Scotland was understood routinely by people at large and not just by those whose words we can read never mind those who self-consciously set out to describe the country the first step to a solution is if we focus on the incidental use of the terms Scotland and Scots in the limited written material we have to hand if Scotland or Scottish or Scot is mentioned only in passing it is likely that it is being used unselfconscioulsy in a way that was unquestioned and common at the time once all incidental references are being gathered together if they are consistent with one particular idea of Scotland it is likely that this was taken for granted and widely accepted as such it can be proposed that it was so deeply embedded in regular discourse that it would have been used instinctively by everyone who had any occasion to bring Scotland to mind but one instinctive idea of Scotland that can be traced consistently is that of the region lying between Moray Argyll and the Forth it is true that apart from the assizes on guarantors for disputed goods the only other text that refers in the same breath to more than one of the limits of this idea of Scotland is a chronicle which describes William the first in twelve fourteen returning from Moray to Scotland and then proceeding from Scotland to Lothian this combined of the assize provides an anchor for the stray indications that Moray or Argyll or Lothian or points beyond were seen as lying outside Scotland reinforcing the impression that each relates to the same single idea of a country bounded by the Forth the Spey and Drumalban this can be corroborated by looking beyond texts in the conventional sense at the evidence of place names particularly in Gaelic the vernacular shared by local communities across almost the entire kingdom in this period if a place name includes a reference to a Scot as its distinctive marker e g Coir' an Albannaich literally corrie of the inhabitant of Scotland it can be inferred that the place itself was not routinely regarded as part of Scotland by those who coined the name otherwise it wouldn't have been distinctive those who coined well coined this were presumably local especially in the case with a name like this they must only have been useful to those who frequented the corrie in question there it is those of you who're mountaineers might have been there while place names like Coir' an Albannaich have the potential therefore to take us directly to Albannach Scot on the lips of people far removed both socially culturally and geographically from the royal clerks and monks who penned the charters chronicles and tracts that we can read again again the evidence is consistent with Albannach as inhabitant to the region bounded by the Forth the Spey and Drumalban and this is significant not only in corroborating what was deduced about the general understanding of Scotland from written sources place names provide evidence more for the use of Scot Albannach than for Scotland whereas with written sources it's the other way around so it is doubly reassuring that these should complement each other the textual references for their part are vital for showing when this instinctive usage was current which can in turn be invaluable for suggeting when the place names with this specific element could have been coined the birth of modern Scottish identity can on the strength of this be said to have involved a radical change in how people at large in the kingdom both north and south of the Forth thought instinctively of Scotland and Scots this can be seen most obviously among those living south of the Forth who began in the thirteenth century to see themselves as Scots living in Scotland presumably those north of the Forth also began routinely to share this identification of country and people with a kingdom even though there was no direct evidence for this before this period how is this change to be explained Scotland is not the only country of course to have its origins in a similar transition in which the name of the historic core as it were was during Central Middle Ages adopted for the territory of the kingdom as a whole it seems natural given the connections between Scotland and France at this time both directly and as part of the ? in the Anglo-Norman world to think of the example of France Suger Abbot of Saint Denis for example writing in the second quarter of the twelfth century talks of Louis the sixth going into France from Berry and from the Auvergne France typically meant an area between the rivers Meuse Loire and euse according to Colette Beaune it was only during the reign of Philipp the second eleven eighty to twelve twenty three that the equation of France with a kingdom became more common she saw the origins of France as essentially a top-down process driven by those closest to the kingship traceable through the formulas deployed by the royal chancery through royal ceremonial and also in histories of French kings climaxing in Les Grandes Chroniques de France a royal initiative of the late thirteenth century Bernd Schneidmueller likewise talks of a theory of French monarchy based on the concept of a royal nation in the thirteenth century that drew on earlier strands of imagining French kingship particularly by those close to the king in symbols chancery practice and history writing this had its origins in what he calls the collective consciousness of the political elites close to the monarchy so could a similar process help to explain what crudely might be called the expansion of Scottish identity in the thirteenth century to embrace the entire kingdom stretching south of the Forth there were certainly deliberate efforts by Alexander the second twelve fourteen to forty nine and Alexander the third twelve forty nine to eighty six and those closest to them to advance a more powerful image of Scottish kingship this includes the adoption of new features in royal charters changes to the royal inauguration ritual in twelve forty nine and also the creation of the first traceable continuous narrative of Scottish history from ancient times written by the Frenchman Richard Vairement probably not long after twelve fifty nine Vairement came to Scotland in twelve thirty nine as chancellor to Queen Marie de Coucy Alexander the second's second wife each of these novelties was designed specifically to proclaim a new sense of Scotland as an independent kingdom there is nothing however to suggest that a broader application of Scottish identity was directly encouraged as part of this programme in fact the idea that the kingdom was particularly associated with north of the Forth far from being ignored plays a conspicuous part in the narrative framework attributable to Richard Vairement to take another example Melrose abbey showed a keen interest in the history of Scottish kings at exactly this time by ins- by by inserting brief notices of each of them throughout his chronicle which was largely English in content up to the twelfth century it is no surprise that Melrose was on message as it were not only was it a royal foundation but it was the burial place of Alexander the second himself and yet it will be recalled that as late as twelve fifty nine the chronicles of Melrose still regarded Scots as the generally unsavoury natives north of the Forth there is nothing here to suggest that those who were close to the kingship were partic- were especially keen to promote any supposed rebranding of the kingdom's inhabitants including the Mel- the monks of Melrose themselves as Scots if Scotland and Scots in the sense we would recognise today originated as an idea that emerged in the century after the eleven eighties it does not seem to have operated in the same way as envisaged by Beaune in France where the transition to a recognisably modern French identity is understood to have originated as part of a royal programme we are left with the suggestion that it may be connected in some way with the growing importance of royal authority in relation to property and possessions and the ironing out of differences north and south of the Forth that came with this a development particularly of the third quarter of the thirteenth century is there any way to be more precise about the proposition that Scotland and Scots originated as ideas when as ideas they were not consciously coined and promoted so far I have argued that Scotland and Scots referring to the area between the Forth Spey and Drumalban and its inhabitants were taken for granted and used instinctively by people at large I've also argued that the new idea of country and people coinciding with the kingdom emerged in the late thirteenth century without being consciously promoted it too would therefore appear to belong to the same non-conscious domain as the older idea of Scotland an important aspect of this is that the new idea of Scotland did not erase the older idea which can still be found in the fifteenth century contradiction of this kind would have been unproblematic as long as it remained on some non-conscious level we've seen a striking example already it'll be recalled that in De Situ Albanie Scotia is referred to in passing in two different senses in the same passage first as including Argyll and then as differentiated from Argyll for its principle part that is ahead is in Argyll in the western part of Scotland above the sea of Ireland its arms however are the mountains which divide Scotland from Argyll returning to the new idea of Scotland the one that endures to this day the challenges to understand how notions of people country and kingdom in people's minds could have coalesced not as the result of anyone's conscious effort but in this non-conscious domain through a form of inarticulate shared experience the relationship between inarticulate shared experience and instinctive ideas brings us naturally to some recent developments in the philosophy of mind instead of focusing on language and conscious thought attention among those in the analytical tradition is focused on perception such as our own Fiona Macpherson's work on hallucination rather than going in that direction however I will turn for help to recent work and what is referred to as the non-conscious background although background has been developed within the philosophy of language as a term for those elements of discourse which are taken for granted it has increasingly been deployed in phenomenology to embrace a deeper range of automatic knowing involving body as well as brain this hinges on the realisation that what we know is a lot more than is processed in consciousness language and rational deliberation to quote Zdravko Radman editor of the book Knowing Without Thinking published last year there he is this non-conscious knowing has been described by Radman as the non-reflective implicit guide in our coping with the world with routine habit shaping who we are this approach has already established an impressive interdisciplinary momentum involving neurology and psychology as well as different branches of philosophy there are possibilities for history too for example our own Susan Stuart has emphasised the crucial importance of our interaction with others linking people together in an essential interdependence with themselves and their world we act in the world not as isolated selves but as conscious socially and culturally embedded phenomenal agents rich in our unique experiential histories but also rich in our greatly distributed complex array of felt affective relations and interrelations with other agents entities and things she didn't write that to be read out so I'm gonna do it again just so we all get this we act in the world not as isolated selves but as conscious socially and culturally embedded phenomenal agents rich in our unique experiential histories but also rich in our greatly distributed complex array of felt affective relations and interrelations with other agents entities and things historians engage with many aspects of shared living which are relevant here such as the regular rhythms of a society the nature of its public arenas and the patterns of criss-crossing personal encounters and this had led some to Bourdieu's concept of habitus but I find this a touch problematic especially given Bourdieu's concern for structures across time and place what Craig Calhoun has called transhistorical invariance philosophy has a great big footnote there which you are missing you'd be glad to know philosophy of mind as articulated by Susan Stuart and others is inherently more sensitive to the historical lived experience can never be static or empty of previous experience it embraces an already living body of unconscious taken for granted ideas there is always an interplay between changing circumstances and existing patterns of thinking with some other possibilites latent in these patterns becoming activated by the lived experience of new emerging social contexts
