so I'm gonna talk about these writers and what I get from them and perhaps that might help us on our way during the course of today so let's take the biggest and perhaps the most problematic of the three first Sir Walter Scott everybody knows that Scott is responsible for a false romanticised view of our history and for creating a fake tartanised national culture and everybody knows that he is impossibly long-winded and dull correct well my very strong impression is that these opinions of Scott are held overwhelmingly by people who have not read much or even any of his work and this in itself is a good reason for reading him to see whether the reality conforms to the myth so first of all I think we have to ask what made Scott so incredibly popular throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth not only in Scotland of course but throughout the world and his principal achievement it seems to me first in his rom- in his epic romantic poems and then in his novels was to make the past that foreign country where they do things differently accessible a place that his contemporaries could all visit and Scott acted as their guide as he showed them around he tried to demonstrate how despite their funny clothes and habits and their wars and their weird political set-ups and the wild nature of the societies in which they often lived the people of the past were pretty much the same as modern people what changed was not basic human nature but the social economic and political conditions which shaped their lives and that's why Scott despite being a a a Conservative politically was so enthusiastically taken up by the Hungarian Marxist critic Georg Lukacs in the nineteen thirties because he recognised that Scott was brilliant at analysing how human beings were affected by the social and economic conditions under which they lived Scott's views on this on history were formed by a mixture of his childhood exposure to oral history and storytelling in the Borders and his education in Edinburgh in the latter part of what we now call the Scottish Enlightenment he was a child of that age which prioritised the Science of Man the study of humans and human society which sought to explore the mysteries of who we are rather than speculate on the insoluble mystery of God or as the American novelist the great American novelist John Dos Passos put it back in nineteen fifty four the professor was taking the place of the clergyman as the venerated figure in Scottish society and you can see this fascination with human life on every page of Scott's work whether it's in his poetry or his fiction or in his history or his essays or reviews or his letters or in his own journal which he wrote for the last six and a half years of his life here for example is the entry from the fifth of January eighteen twenty six in his journal people say that the whole human frame in all its parts and divisions is gradually in the act of decaying and renewing what a curious time-piece it would be that could indicate to us the moment this gradual and insensible change had so completely taken place that no atom was left of the original person who had existed at a certain period but there existed in his stead another person having the same limbs and thewes and sinews the same face and lineaments the same consciousness a new ship built on an old plank singular to be at once another and the same Scott was obsessively interested in the past but not to the exclusion of the present or the future in fact and now you can say that he was obsessively interested in the passage of time and what that passage of time did to individuals and the wider communities to which they belonged in the final chapter or postscript erm to Waverley his first novel his massively successful ground-breaking novel about the Jacobite rising of seventeen forty five seventy six which was published two hundred years ago next year he wrote the following there is no European nation which within the course of half a century or little more has undergone so complete a change as this kingdom of Scotland actually pretty debatable I think he'd forgotten about the French Revolution but never mind and then he goes on to talk about erm erm he says the the the failure of the seventeen forty five rising had led to the destruction of a Highland clan system and the wholesale reorganisation of the dispensing of jus- juspens- dispensation of justice throughout Scotland and this had been followed by commercial and scientific and agricultural innovations in other words he's talking about the whole progress and process of the Enlightenment an increase in national and private wealth and the early stirrings of industrial revolution but Scott goes on but the change though steadily and rapidly progressive has nevertheless been gradual and like those who drift down the stream of a deep and smooth river we are not aware of the progress we have made until we fix our eye on the now distant point from which we have been drifted I love that that stark metaphor for for for the passage of time steady and rapid progress which is at the same time gradual don't we all feel this is it really five years since so-and-so died or your sister got married and went to Australia is it possible that fifteen years ago the vast majorit- majority of us had neither internet access nor mobile phones and the idea that you might be able to access your bank account or send a photo to your sister in Australia from your phone while sitting in a cafe in Barcelona well you get the point I'm trying to make our simultaneous engagement with and alienation from progress is no different really from what Walter Scott was feeling and thinking and writing about now as a tour guide into the past Scott was best on the territory he knew best he wrote best when he wrote about his own country Scotland and it's his Scottish novels that in my view have really lasted the Scotland of his long poems and his first nine novels and then one or two a wee bit later erm was familiar to other Scots yet Scott still somehow made it new and exciting especially in the way he encouraged you the reader to travel across not only timelines or fault-lines of religion war and culture not least to travel across the Highland Line Scott's sometimes accused of erm in fact he was accused in his own lifetime of of a a Celtification of Scottish culture but it's not really fair to blame Scott for for that even if it's blameworthy erm because all he was doing was really building on the previous generation's infatuation with Ossian erm but what Scott was also doing there I think was making a serious attempt to knit together erm the cultures of the Lowlands and the Highlands and that was just for his Scottish readers but for his non-Scottish readers he presented i- in all its parts an exotic and largely unknown country did he create a romanticised view of it well he lived in a romantic age the romantic age erm but was he really responsible for the way people responded to his novels I'm not sure that you can say that he was books are a two-way process I know there's very much as a as a as a writer you write the book and then it goes out there and actually as long as the book stays closed it's it's dead it's when somebody opens it up then it become- erm it comes alive again and the reader contributes at least as much to the book as the writer does and Scott's fiction is heavily laced with doses of irony if you look for them he's not just writing some kind of erm easy romantic version of of Scotland or of Scottish of the Scottish history he's actually often erm poking fun and laughing at the romanticising of the past his heroes like Edward Waverley are deliberately blank canvases so that Scott can have fun at their expense he can make them fall for the romantic and then drag them back into sober reality and into the present after they'd been thoroughly impressed upon in the course of their adventures erm Waverley he fave- he famously described Edward Waverley in a letter to a friend as a sneaking piece of imbecility and I kind of see Edward Waverley as an empty carriage into which the gentle reader steps at the start of the novel and from which he or she descends at the end and the last laugh possibly that Scott has is on his readers and it's the same with the supposed heroes of some of his other novels Rob Roy The Antiquary Guy Mannering Redgauntlet actually these heroes they are quite flat and two-dimensional in some ways but they're not the main attraction it's the characters they meet who are fas- fascinating and memorable I don't have time today to go into the details of why Scott at his best is so good but here are a couple of examples if you're looking for a way of engaging your pu- students in this coming referendum year with the idea that the yes no question of independence has been around for a long time then hand out a sheet and remember that Scott is out of copyright so you can do this hand out a sheet with the following conversation from the novel Rob Roy this is the section when the the the hero Frank Osbaldistone is riding into bandit country erm which we know today as the Trossachs in the company of his girny manservant Andrew Fairservice and the Glasgow merchant Bailie Nicol Jarvie it's just before the Jacobite rising of seventeen fifteen and they as they ride Jarvie who is a Unionist and Fairservice who is a nationalist argue about the merits of the Union which had only taken place a a few years before and Frank the young English hero is narrating
