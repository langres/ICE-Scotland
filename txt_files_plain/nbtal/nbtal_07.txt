in two thousand and twelve erm Joe Wilson and I were both at the OER Conference in Cambridge which was run jointly with the Open Courseware Consortium and Sir John Daniel was presenting a keynote on UNESCO's government OER draft declaration consultation at the time there had been no formal response from the UK however Westminster did subsequently respond and that was in ?  part due to his encouragement from JISC and I think David Curran who is here today was instrumental in getting a response to that consultation however as far as we know the consultation document didn't make it north of the border and there was no formal response from the Scottish government or from anyone in Scotland indeed at the same time Hefce funded erm UK OER programmes which would be run by JISC and the Higher Education Academy who're making huge strides in releasing open e- open educational resources and embedding open practice in institutions south of the border now while Scottish education can benefit from the resources produced by the UK OER programmes institutions have been slower to respond to the cultural shift required to embed open practices in education and these are the two factors that prompted erm Joe to suggest that it would be useful for o- for erm organisations such as ALTS  Cetus and erm the RAC to work together to raise awareness of the benefits of openness in education and support the development of open education policy and open policy in general in Scotland we hope that this event will provide a starting point to identify shared strategic interests and start developing open policies and practices that will benefit the Scottish education sector as a whole hopefully this will go some way towards helping us to achieve the benefits identified by the UNESCO and accompanying their Paris OER declaration UNESCO believes that universal acts- access to high quality education is key to the building of peace sustainable social and economic development and intercultural dialogue open educational resources provide a strategic opportunity to improve the quality of education as well as facilitate policy dialogue knowledge sharing  and capacity building
