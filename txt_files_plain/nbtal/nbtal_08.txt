on the fourteenth of June nineteen eighty five representatives of five out of the ten members of the then European Economic Community EEC Belgium France West Germany the Netherlands and Luxembourg gathered on the Princesse Marie-Astrid a boat moored on the banks of the Moselle river in Luxembourg their pens were poised over a pact that aimed to dissolve the internal borders of Europe the agreement was named after the nearby riverside town Schengen there were only five signatories because the other EEC members including Britain were dragging their feet but the bureaucrats had only to glance at the vineyards outside to remember why they were here to the east of the river lay Germany a short distance upstream was France Belgium was only a bike ride away and the Netherlands a cursory drive the people who lived in this corner of Europe criss-crossed national borders all the time wouldn't it be marvellous if they didn't have to be scrutinised as if they were spies when they were only nipping over the river to buy a sausage or deliver a letter it was also an evocative place in another way this terrain of hills and forests was haunted by centuries of bloodshed it was where France Germany and Britain had fought many of their wars Waterloo was an hour or so to the west by car Verdun was even closer the Battle of the Bulge had raged just north of here in nineteen forty four and early nineteen forty five the Schengen Agreement was an attempt to lay such awful ghosts to rest from now on people would not have to show passports but could simply drive slowly across the frontiers David Cameron has received much flack for reminding voters of this detail but it would be shallow to ignore it the agreement had a significant effect not just on daily life but on tourism trading commerce in the nineteen nineties many of the old and new members of the European Union signed up and the expansion continued in the two thousands with the joining of non-members such as Norway Iceland and Switzerland today the Schengen area is made up of twenty six European countries all the while Britain and Ireland anxious behind their sea walls shook their heads Schengen was an optimistic idea and anyone who's worked or holidayed in Europe since nineteen eighty five has felt the ease that it has brought to the crossing of borders but as it celebrates its coming of age twenty one years since its inception Schengen is in the dock those who designed it to liberate movement in Europe did not imagine international migration on today's scale partly as a result of the speed of modern travel and communications more than two hundred and forty million people now live outside the country of their birth
