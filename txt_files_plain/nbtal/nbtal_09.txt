the Decent Work Zone Campaign  mobilises precarious workers and the unemployed it's a campaign set up to organise workers who wouldn't be traditionally targeted by trade unions the Decent Work Zone Campaign has five key demands access to a trade union a wage we can live on guaranteed hours each week safe secure work and training and development opportunities this campaign came from the idea from the s- fast food workers in America they fought for union recognition decent hours and a decent wage and we've seen them  win they took a day of action in New York where workers went on strike demanding that their campaign is listened to on that same day the New York Wage Board voted to pay   two hundred thousand men and women fast food workers in the union fifteen dollars an hour an industry which makes twenty billion dollars a year and by twenty eighteen all workers in the state will be paid the fifteen dollars an hour in a country where union membership is low union recognition there's lack of it and where the private sector runs rul- rules the roost if they can make change there we can do it here we we organise workers who are not in a typically organised workplace it's about changing the face of our movement the rise of zero-hours contracts the continuous cuts to our basic services the Tory living wage which says if you're under twenty five your work isn't as valued as much as somebody over that age this is creating a race to the bottom this isn't a cost-saving exercise this isn't a way of raising efficiency this is a Tory ideological class war we as a Labour movement have always stood up for the masses not the few and this is why the campaign is integral to our movement and now I'd like to introduce Erin McAuley who is a worker on a zero-hours contract thank you ve-
