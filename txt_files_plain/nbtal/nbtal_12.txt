this campaign's erm this campaign starts with the individual and brings a man in the collective giving people their own place and space to develop identifying talents that we can build share and utilise showing them to s- erm h- h- showing them how to step outside their comfort zone growing them as a person which in turn grows our movement for a better life and a better future for all this is something I hold dear to my heart dyslexic at stool school a face being put into a box going into the workplace I thought life would be different but seeing myself being put into a box because of my age time and time again I'd hear prejudice thui- prejudice thoughts of what mana- what work management thought I could and couldn't do I somehow had a bad attitude towards work for question and funds and I thought to myself surely as a company you'd want to get the best out of your workers and what they could do utilising the skills of your staff surely as an employer you want your worker to be happy that so they they're more productive to me that made business sense it was not until I get involved in trade unions I've seen the changes you could bring to your workplace and how inspiring our movement is with such a rich history a rich history of normal people standing together fighting for the rights that made worklife better and winning a rich history I was never taught in school the system failed me but my moveme- the movement yeah my movement and my family wouldn't allow me to fail myself and what a great message to give to young people you can make positive change you don't need to fall through life accepting things as they are the chance to work in this campaign with so many inspirational young people is a dream come true for me to fight ag- to fight against young adults young adults seeing their future ripped out their hands and optimism crushed at the first steps the false choice of get a job or get an education education it sees young people shackled with debt for the rest of their life and what jobs precarious work we have a Tory government not giving under twenty fives their v- their phony living wage in their words they're not as productive giving the green light for companies and society to take a certain view on young work workers in the workplace along with the explosion of zero-hour contracts that see you with no rights no sick pay no holiday pay no maternity rights these are rights that we fought for and won you come up against the argument but they're flexible but flexible for who the bosses you heard Erin's experience of zero-hour contracts the scars mentally and physically that she experienced a scar in her chin reminding her every day of her first work experience and these stories echo across the country that's why ? Unite say that zero-hour contracts must be banned outright of course there is a small percentage of people that agree with zero-hour contracts but after meeting hundreds and hundreds of young people that have on zero-hour contracts I've not met one that agrees with them yet and to quote Spock and IMAX that's quite a funny erm logic clearly dictates the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few that's why our young activists came on erm SportsDirect make actually use of ninety percent zero-hour contracts an ideological war of how staff should be treated in his eyes search before they go home a culture and what a culture of zero-hour contracts creates challenge anything you find yourself of no shifts a woman giving birth in the warehouse a man lay dead in their erm workplace canteen for four hours our activists have taken this message to the streets demos flashmobs with new ways of protesting banner drops at Newcastle football stadium as well as ? where fans are affected by this man's greed giving the e- getting the message into the media and capturing the imagination of others of what can be achieved when we stand together I now say this Mike Ashley we won't stop until you change your ways we have won we have won the campaigns against Pizza Express and Las Iguanas stealing staff tips and we will win in SportsDirect because if we let this treatment of workers goes on go on it's not so much a race to the bottom but a sleepwalk we have organised young people through art music and culture and this might seem oversimplistic but puts social back into socialism activists getting to know one another and finding a common cause we have clear goals clear vision we ask for your support and to get young people involved in our campaign we will keep growing and inspiring building confidence till the boss can't ig- the bosses can't ignore us and the politicians don't just listen to us but get out in the street and campaign with us so as a young guy I always imagined that if I ever made a movie it would be great to be in the cinema and our young activists have created a video on the TU Bill it doesn't seem like the best fun to pick to create a video on it's a very lengthy process but I think erm what we've achieved with erm a three-minute video explains the TU Bill very erm very well and this is an issue that we need young people to understand that this is about going through parliament that affects all of us if young people don't have trade unions fighting in their corner erm they probably won't miss them because they've never had trade unions so we need to educate young people on trade unions and we need to get this bill erm raise awareness of this bill it might not be a slu- summer blockbuster but let's hope we can get this message out there as much as we can thank you very much conference
