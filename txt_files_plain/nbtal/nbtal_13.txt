I joined this campaign when I was still a young Unite activist I was on a low-hour low-pay job I've now managed to break my cycle of precarious work and now that I am on a living wage the impact that that's had on my life mentally and physically has been incredible so I'll continue to be involved in this campaign coz I believe that every young person deserves that opportunity this isn't about individuality this is about standing together and creating change as a collective now you've heard from ANON the true reality of being on a zero-hour contract it's not just the inability to fund your life but it's a detrimental effect it has on your mental health these contracts are exploitative and they're demoralising they're telling young people that they they are not worthy of having decent work it's not giving them a hope to find a secure future many people like you to believe that they're flexible as we've heard they're only flexible for the employer it takes any control that that worker has over their own life and puts it straight into the hands of bosses these are corporate bosses who care more about profits that they make than the the well-being and the health of the people that they actually employ we have had young people up and down this country join our campaign many of whom had never heard of a trade union or had never been involved with anything political no they had been stamped on and pushed to the edge for so long by exploitative bosses that they finally realised they had to stand up against them they now realise that they have rights and that they need to take that fight to protect those rights into their own hands now we have five basic pledges for decent work in this campaign as you heard at the start now these campai- these pledges have been taken to councils up and down the country and my local Labour erm erm Labour councillor sorry who is in this room somewhere took them to my local council which is run by the SNP now we asked them for their support and the response that we got back was absolutely disgusting they put in black and white and stated that our demands were unreasonable and they were just impossible to implement now conference it should never be unreasonable for a young worker to ask for a wage that they can actually live on it should it should not be impossible to get rid of zero-hour contracts and give a guaranteed number of hours to a worker each week now that's why I'm actually really grateful to be standing here in this platform I'm really grateful to our party's leadership of Kesia and Alex to allow us to be here today and tell us about our campaign and about this issue this issue is too important to not get behind this campaign is too important to not get involved in we run the risk of letting these growing working practices become the norm up and down this country not having enough income to fund your life just becomes the norm not having the courage to voice your opinion in your workplace without the fear of getting sacked that just becomes the norm these are things that our movement has fought long and hard for and is our fight to make sure that their rights are protected so what I ask is for everyone in here it is great that we have got the support of the leadership but we need your support we need every single Labour member to come out with us and stand on the streets and be visible to people to show them that we are actively trying to create change and not just talking about it we need to prove to young people that we are the party for them we were formed for ordinary people the many not the few we are still that party and we will still continue that fight we need to prove to those young workers that we can be their voice we can be their voice on the street we'll be their voice in the workplace but we'll be their voice in parliament as well now as  everyone else has said in their speeches before you know this is an political an ideological attack on our class and our young people don't be mistaken that this is turning into a class war and we as the Labour Party need to make sure that we're on the winning side of that war for our young people and for our movement so thanks
