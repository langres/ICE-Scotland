good afternoon conference my name is ANON I'm a proud member of Unite I want to stress here today the importance of trade unions to young people and to the Scottish Labour Party low-paid insecure work is a reality for thousands of young people across this country profits in the service sector are growing yet the benefits of this are not being shared with our class erm they are not being shared with the real wealth creators in society the workers income inequality is rising wages are stagnating young people are living in in-work poverty and in many cases suffering with work and just mental health issues now this degregation of working conditions has not been met with sufficient workplace resistance the Labour Movement let's be frank is at its weakest in decades Union membership has halved since nineteen eighty investment in our economy is geared towards financial speculation and property rather than manufacture and infrastructure the minimum wage has become the standard wage the Labour Party has to fight this the Labour Party has to be at the forefront of the Labour Movement we have to be shown to ac- be actually concerned with the day to day working conditions of ordinary people Labour needs to take a leading role in the workplace we need to be on the picket lines we need to be active within these campaigns such as Decent Work Zone and Better Than Zero critically we need to engage with those most exploited in the workplace which is young people most young people today are not in a trade union I'd argue that many do not know what trade unions even do when I started working in my current pub I was the only union member yet people my age are those that need trade unions the most we are the most likely to be on a zero-hours contract we won't even be paid the government's mockery of a living wage erm many of my peers are in temporary contracts in high turnover unskilled jobs with little to no chance of career progression we cannot afford our rent we cannot afford to go for higher education we cannot escape the minimum wage now Labour and the Trade Union Movement can help us yet the average age of a trade unionist is forty the average age of a trade union rep is fifty five I can praise the work of campaigns like ours I can thank the party of Young- Scottish Young Labour Scottish Labour Young Socialists and Kezia Dugdale for endorsing our campaign but it's not enough we need to get support from all levels of the party and we need young people to get actively involved in these campaigns and we need the Labour Party to spearhead these movements now now I'm not here today to chastise the old guard of the party for ignoring young voices nor am I here today to criticise anyone who isn't already involved in a trade union instead I'm trying to make the point that not only do the working class of this country benefit from a strong Trade Union Movement but also that if we ever want to recover in Scotland we need to take that leading role now young people don't associate our party with workplace issues the SNP are posturing to become the natural home for Scottish trade unions our neglect of trade unions has led has crippled our support within their political infrastructures especially amongst the young now me and Erin sat on the Unite p- Youth Committee in Scotland there's about twenty places me and Erin are the only Labour members on that committee senior figures and a variety of trade unionists have been endorsing nationalist parties only fifteen percent of young people are gonna back Labour because they see the SNP's progressive voters trust the Scottish government more on than trade unions on issues surrounding the wor- the workers that those unions are meant to represent our support in working class communities and workplaces is crashing down around us nationalism is hegemonic in Scottish politics and is our as socialists it is our job to return class to the political agenda we can do that but we need a vibrant social movement geared towards issues surrounding working people and one that challenges the prevailing nationalist narrative social movements need the support of the young and I was delighted to see the surge of young people getting involved with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership campaign however we can't just sit around and be self-congratulatory that's the job of the SNP now we need Labour Young Labour Labour Students Labour Young Socialists the CFS the Scottish Labour PLP any Labour grouping you can think of to get actively involved with these grassroots campaigns for the sake of young workers like Erin and for the sake of our party this is our fight we need to champion it I'm both a trade unionist and a Labour Party member to me the two are inseparable the cause of the Labour Movement the cause of the Labour Movement the cause of the Trade Union Movement is the cause of the Labour Party please conference get involved help us deliver for young people help us deliver for the working class and help us deliver for Labour thank you
