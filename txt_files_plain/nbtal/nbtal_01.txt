dean ladies and gentlemen three hundred and few sorry three hundred and three years ago today on twenty second November seventeen ten the newly appointed Professor of Civil Law entered the premises shown on the screen and started and I quote his public lessons in the common hall of the college of Edinburgh he was showing great devotion to duty because the twenty second of November was a Saturday these were the first classes in civil law indeed the first classes in law at all to be taught in the actual buildings of the university Craig's Saturday public lessons were not the start of his classes or indeed may I say the main content of his teaching he had in fact been teaching the civil law since May how had this come about I shall set out the background briefly before returning to Craig and his endeavours now there can be no doubt absolutely no doubt that the Scottish legal profession wished civil law to be taught in a Scottish university and in particular in that of Edinburgh why they did so  is easily stated by seventeen hundred men were admitted t- to the Scots bar solely by series of examinations on the civil or the Roman law they were examined first of all viva voce in Latin on civil law they then made a public defence of a Latin thesis on a title of the civil law here you see that of John Spottiswoode a few days later wearing a hat a symbolic thing to do they delivered from the actual bench of the Court of Session a- a speech on one of the laws of that title and we have here John Spottiswoode's draft of his own speech this procedure was modelled on the examinations for a doctorate in law in many continental universities what it did mean was that Scots had to have a high standard of knowledge of the civil law to become an advocate and the best way to gain this was at a university as is well known around seventeen hundred Scots tended to go to the universities of the United Provinces of the Netherlands then in a golden period a- and indeed it's wo- it's nice to know the links with the Netherlands are still active today and there are representatives a- amongst us from universities of Groningen Leiden Rotterdam and the Free University of Amsterdam which is very pleasing in a period when there's current controversy over the cost and funding of university education it is worth pointing out the huge expense of such foreign study it cost a Scots student about a hundred pounds a year to study in the university of Netherland a- in the in the university of say Leiden and I mean a hundred pounds sterling not a hundred pounds Scots this is an enormous sum to give a comparator in the early eighteenth century a farm servant earned two pounds sterling a year to give you an interesting comparator there the farm servant also got board of course but it's still an indication of just the cost but such an education was not just beyond the bounds of possibility for a poor man it was extremely costly for the minor landed classes and it was from the minor landed classes that the membership of the factive advocates was largely drawn a good estate might bring in two hundred pounds a year but most many estates are encumbered they had debts there was mortgages so such an education was very expensive and very difficult to achieve so creation of an effective chair of civil law at home was wanted to save money then as now politics and money are a large part of this history of education ? where was the money to come from to endow a chair one possible source was parliament but here a second problem arises a well-connected man called Alexander Cunningham had been tutor to Lord Lorne the future second Duke of Argyll and he'd also been tutor to Lord George Douglas the younger brother of the second Duke of Queensberry these two noblemen were briefly in alliance in sixteen ninety nine normally they were not but in sixteen ninety nine they managed to get the Scottish parliament in the act ? of the ? to grant Cunningham an annual payment of a hundred and fifty pound sterling remember that is an enormous sum per year and I quote as the yearly fee and salary of the professor of civil law and the act was to be in effect for five years in seventeen oh four it was renewed for a further five years now Cunningham the favoured tutor had not sought to become professor of the civil law for all of Scotland as parliament had made him and he had no intention of teaching he had simply wanted money to support his work on a new edition of Justinian's Digest which he was pursuing  in the Netherlands and the Digest is the most important text of Roman law dating from the five thirties A D but Cunningham's patrons of course had to make the grant of money to him acceptable to their fellow politicians so they made him professor of civil law in all of Scotland the problem that I've mentioned was the act was interpreted as having conferred upon erm Cunningham a parliamentary privilege that th- prevented the creation of a new uni- of a new university chair to teach civil law he was judged to have an exclusive privilege in the right thus when the first chair of law was created in Edinburgh in seventeen oh seven it was not in civil law but in public law and the law of nature and nations and the new professor was specifically instructed that he could not teach civil law because of Cunningham's privilege but the demand for civil law remained and Leslie mentioned erm the Enlightenment and we're here at the century erm in which Adam Smith became one of the most famous of Scots and it's worth remember reminding ourselves that demand creates markets markets meet demands as if by an invisible hand from sixteen ninety nine onwards a number of private teachers all advocates offered classes in civil law in Edinburgh these teachers competed fiercely with one another there was what one can only describe as an advertising war until eventually one dominant teacher emerged and started to monopolise the teaching of the civil law from around six seven ? six onwards this teacher was another Cunningham John Cunningham no close kin to Alexander and the title page of Cunningham's own inaugural lecture is here but this is I remember a private class not a university class Cunningham taught in two sessions a winter and a summer this reflected contemporary university practice he taught an entire course in Justinian Institutes the elementary Roman law textbook in each of these sessions and a course on the Digest the giant anthology of the writings of Roman lawyers that ran over both sessions and one can note amongst his pupils Andrew Fletcher the future Lord Milton Cunningham died very suddenly on the first of May sventeen ten just after starting his summer session of seventeen ten there then followed another advertising war in the Scottish newspapers this time even more frenzy than the earlier one by those who wished to capture his classes both his classes in civil law and his classes in Scots law I should just set out this war two days after Cunningham's death John Spottiswoode advertised that he would continue Cunningsfem's Cunningham's classes on Scots law Justinian's Institutes and the Digest two days after that advertisement James Craig our future professor advertised that he would continue Cunningham's classes on Institutes and the Digest ten days after that James Leslie advertised that he would take over Cunningham's Scots law classes four days following that advertisement Robert Craigie a future Lord President of the Court of Session advertised that he would take over Cunningham's classes on the Institutes and Digest a week later Sir Archibald Sinclair advertised classes just on the Institutes finally Malcolm Gregory advertised that he would teach the Institutes and Digest to and I quote to supply the great want and most sensible loss caused by the death of John Cunningham that so many wished to capture Cunningham's classes testifies to his success and demonstrates the demand for such classes on civil law the competitive advertising can seem almost desperate advertisers offered a special service or emphasised some particular skill or experience stressing what ma- modern marketing men would call the value edit it is difficult to measure their success it may be however that we can deduce problems in acquiring a class from the rate of advertising for example Sinclair advertised thirty one times in the newspapers Craig advertised only four times probably because he quickly got a class this is a an extract of a letter from another Sinclair John Sinclair to Andrew Fletcher Fletcher whom you'd seen had been attending Cunningham's class I have to say I rather like Sinclair's spelling which phonetically represents his obviously very Scottish vowel sounds he was I think a son of the Earl of Caithness while information in Sinclair's letter may not be entirely accurate erm if you say Mister Bob Craigie has given it quite over that- that's probably wrong we know Robert Craigie did get a class it shows that Craig had got going Craig had started to have a class as the winter session approached the advertising war broke out again even fiercer than before we know that in the winter session of seventeen ten Craig acquired a class in civil law Robert Craigie acquired a class and so did Sir Archibald Sinclair his thirty one advertisements had finally paid off it must have been obvious to any observer from this frenetic advertising in the Scottish newspapers and the fact that three classes were being taught in civil law by different teachers that there was a viable market for classes in civil law it is also worth remembering that this is seventeen ten and by now Cunningham's privilege has expired his parliamentary privilege has expired it was certainly noticed in this building the toll booth of Edinburgh where the town council sat it was also noticed by the principal and masters of the university thus we find on eighteenth October seventeen ten an entry in the minutes of the town council to the effect and I quote from its preamble considering that through want of professors of civil law in this kingdom the youths who have applied themselves to that study have been necessitate to travel and remain abroad a considerable time for their education to the prejudice to the prejudice of the nation by the necessary changes occasioned thereby the minute then goes on to narrate the success of a number of private teachers and the town council then elects James Craig to be professor of civil law in the university of Edinburgh now perhaps I should interject here for those do not know that the university of Edinburgh had been founded by the town council and the town council as patrons ran the non-academic aspects of the university including appointing virtually all professors except the Regius professors who were appointed by the Crown it's clear that the town's council's appointment of Craig must have been satisfactory to him he's certainly excepted accepted it but there was what Americans would call a kicker and you see it's set out here from the town council's minute not a good precedent to follow I may say there was no endowment to provide a salary so Craig was told not to expect one but Craig probably did not mind what he had got was the endorsement of the town council he was no longer a private teacher he was a university professor this gave him a competitive edge we don't know what he charged for his classes but if it's com- comparable to what other private teachers were charging in this period it would be between three to five pounds sterling a class per student this again is an enormous sum five students you get four erm five students and four pounds is twenty pounds this is a significant sum remember as I told you an agricultural labour earns two pounds a year well who is this man James Craig why was he appointed he was descended from a distinguished legal family he was the great-great-grandson of Thomas Craig of Riccarton the famous writer on feudal law his father Lewis Craig died in sixteen eighty one leaving five sons and five daughters all under age James was the fourth son aged between five and nine at his father's death there's no record of his baptism but he's between five and nine Craig matriculated in Edinburgh in sixteen ninety one and graduated M A in sixteen ninety four he then proceeded to the University of Franeker in the Netherlands matriculating in sixteen ninety five studying under Zacharias Huber the finger in the photo points to his signature in their album Jacobus Craig he was still in Franeker in s- December sixteen ninety seven when he defended the thesis pictured on the slide one of his elder brothers Robert also an advocate had also studied in Franeker under Zacharias's father the rather more famous Ulrich I always feel sorry that tif- if you can read it and you can can see the Latin it describes Zacharias Huber as son of Ulrich but Robert as I said Robert also an advocate had studied in Franeker under Ulrich Huber we know that Robert then moved to study in Utrecht and I think it is quite likely that James did so too however this may be James was admitted as an advocate in seventeen oh one following a public examination on his thesis on twenty eight June as I've mentioned James's father had died leaving ten surviving underage children this was not a good strategy to secure the financial position of a minor landed family such as the Craigs of Riccarton were Craig was the fourth son but he was eventually to inherit the estate of Riccarton which is where Heriot-Watt University now stands and I think the estate stayed in the family solely because it was entailed the entailment that it was impossible to sell it away from the line of succession or burden it with further debt what property was not entailed was certainly encumbered with debt and two of James's brothers who had inherited Riccarton before him were very heavily indebted indeed and his brother Robert who was also the advocate erm was bankrupted in the early eighteenth century the Craigs of Riccarton were desperately clinging on by the fingernail finger- finger erm nails to their landed status they were in danger of losing it I've no evidence about the state of Craig's practice of the bar though his personal erm papers suggest that he was not particularly in straightened circumstances himself he managed to avoid involvement in his brother's crash nevertheless it is easy to see ? he might have been interested in a university position to gain extra and secure income this is where we turn to the second image on the screen that of William Carstares Carstares lived in interesting times he is a fascinating character he was a man of principle he was also a very tough political fixer he was the minister of the kirk and he'd been educated in the universities of Edinburgh and Utrecht during the sixteen sixties and sixteen seventies under Charles the second he was in and out of prison in Britain in S- he spent time in exile in the Netherlands and he was in fact close to William Prince of Orange at one stage he was erm indeed rightly accused of implication in England of involvement in a plot to overthrow the government of Charles the second at this time the English Privy Council no longer had the authority to issue torture warrants so Carstares was sent north to Edinburgh in this Stuart version rendition he suffered the use of the thumbscrews note the prominence of one of the thumbs in this portrait after his confession coz he did confess he was allowed to return to Holland he became minister to the English language church i- in Leiden and he became Prince William's court chaplain in sixteen eighty eight he sailed with William for Britain in the glorious revolution he lived in London but was Royal chaplain for Scotland and what he did was he helped manage Scottish political affairs from London after William's death he moved to Scotland to become principal of the university of Edinburgh in seventeen oh three now Carstares is rightly remembered as a great reforming principal he abolished the old system of teaching known as regenting and instituted the system of allocating each teacher a special subject as a professor he also wanted to develop new faculties and it is largely due to his endeavours the school of law the faculty of law was created exactly when it was it is helpful if I say a little about Scottish politics of this period though Queen Ann was still in the throne in seventeen ten Britain was shortly t- erm to embark on the long period what used to be known as the Whig Ascendency in Scotland politics were starting to coalesce around two Whig factions one known as the ? focused around the second duke of Argyll and his quite exceptionally talented brother the Earl of Ilay and the other known as the Squadroni Valenti a grouping of interrelated families dominated by the Dukes of Montrose and Roxburghe and the Earl of Tweeddale the most notable legal family in the Squadroni was that of Dundas of Arniston by seventeen ten Craig and his brother Robert were certainly associating with the Squadroni group and Craig's second wife James Craig's second wife was to be christianed Dundas of the Arniston family so it's fairly clear that there was a Squadroni political element to his appointment in seventeen ten to the chair
