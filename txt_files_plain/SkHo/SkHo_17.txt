Why not grow your own tasty salads?

If you’re craving the fresh taste of newly-grown 
    vegetables – you can have them sooner than you think.
Dougal Philip of New Hopetoun Gardens, whose garden centre near 
    Edinburgh is full at the moment with grow-your-own essentials, 
    recommends using herbs to fill up the salad bowl.
“Rocket, spicy oriental mixes and mustards will all grow 
    well now if you start them off on a warm windowsill. And if you cut 
    just what you need when they are around 10cm high you’ll get two or 
    three croppings from every sowing.”
Dougal also recommends planting rosemary (left) now so you can 
    have some with your Easter lamb.
“At New Hopetoun we grow rosemary along with sage in 
    wooden tubs underneath standard bay trees, planted into John Innes 
    No 2 soil-based compost to provide it with good drainage,” 
    he explains.
You can add to the fresh flavours by digging up clumps of mint 
    and chives and bringing them indoors where they’ll put on rapid 
    growth.
Dougal says: “Just treat them as houseplants, growing 
    them in a bright position and making sure they don’t go short of 
    water.”
And for even more rapid results, why not sprout some seeds?
“Give them some warmth and moisture and you’ll soon be 
    able to snip off tasty seedlings to scatter over your favourite 
    recipes. Young pea shoots are particularly good.”
