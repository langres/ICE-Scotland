Scots businesswoman to reveal secret recipe for perfect 
    macaron at new classes
It is an icon of French patisserie and a staple of the 
    Great British Bake Off, but how do you make the perfect 
    macaron?
Well, wonder no longer, as Scots businesswoman Rachel Hanretty, 
    a.k.a. Mademoiselle Macaron, has promised to reveal her secret 
    recipe during her new macaron making classes.
Rachel will hold classes at the Edinburgh School of Food and 
    Wine on Wednesday, November 13 and Wednesday, December 11 2013, 
    with dates also planned for 2014.
Foodies will get the chance to learn how to make five different 
    flavours of macaron during each class. They will also walk away 
    with a box of baked goodies at the end of the class.
Rachel said: "Mademoiselle is a cheeky Scottish 
    lassie bringing the luxury of French macarons and Parisian style to 
    her native Scotland.
"We are very happy to say we are working with the 
    Edinburgh School of Food and Wine to host two macaron 
    classes.
"You will learn five different flavours of macaron 
    and walk away with enough macarons for you and your 
    friends.
"Wow your friends and family this Christmas with 
    macarons."
Rachel, a HeraldScotland blogger, launched her French patisserie 
    business, which specialises in macarons, earlier this year.
Her tasty treats have already been snapped up by a number of 
    Scots stores.
Mademoiselle Macaron's cooking classes will run from 
    6pm-9pm.
