Puppet musical for grown ups, Avenue Q, makes Eden Court 
    debut

AVENUE Q, the 
    award-winning Broadway and West End hit musical that mixes 
    "puppets, porn and the purpose of 
    life" will make its Eden Court debut in June as part 
    of a 10 week UK-wide tour.
Winner of Best Musical, Best Score and Best Book at the 2004 
    Tony Awards, Avenue Q is a hugely popular coming of age satire 
    inspired by Sesame Street, but aimed at an adult audience.
Featuring songs by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx such as 
    The Internet is for Porn, If You Were 
    Gay and Everyoneâ€™s A Little Bit 
    Racist, Avenue Q places puppets and 
    puppeteers alongside human actors.
Avenue Q first appeared in 2003 at the 
    Off-Broadway theatre the Vineyard before transferring to Broadway 
    later that year. Cameron Mackintosh produced it in the West End in 
    2006, where it ran for five years before touring, and has appeared 
    in more than ten countries all over the world.
The current production opens at Greenwich Theatre on Wednesday 
    23rd April ahead of a national tour from May to August 2014.
It is produced by the Sell a Door Theatre Company, based in 
    Greenock and Greenwich, most of whose work is aimed at teens and 
    young adults with the aim of exciting them to the possibilities of 
    theatre.
"This is our third major musical production 
    following Spring Awakening in 2011 and Seussical in 2012 and 
    2013," artistic director David Hutchinson said.
"I have every faith that this parable, which so 
    cleverly pokes fun at the issues young people face going into 
    adulthood, will strike a chord with audiences up and down the 
    country."
Avenue Q comes to Eden Court Theatre, 
    Inverness on Tuesday 17th and Wednesday 18th June and tickets are 
    on sale now via the theatre box office.
The show is suitable for 14 upwards.
