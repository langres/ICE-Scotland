Walk of the week: Glen Etive

by ROBIN HOWIE
Long daylight hours in the summer months lend 
    themselves to more ambitious hillwalking plans.
Twenty-five years ago, we set off on a two-day backpacking trip, 
    from Ben Starav to Meall a’Bhuiridh; an eight-Munro traverse from 
    Glen Etive to Glen Coe involving a total ascent of over 3,000m. 
    However, too heavily laden on a scorching day and having to stop at 
    every opportunity for water, by the time we reached Stob Coir’ an 
    Albannaich the thought of a second day of masochism was too much to 
    contemplate.
Revisiting that idea was planned but this time, older and wiser, 
    I opted for a more modest five-Munro 24 hours 2,500m traverse, 
    going only as far as Meall nan Eun and taking a bivvy bag rather 
    than full camping gear. With low cloud forecast to gradually rise 
    during the day, I delayed my departure until 11:30am and returned 
    at exactly that time next morning, a most enjoyable 24 hours 
    including a memorable bivvy.
Given the initial cooler weather it was sensible to start with 
    Ben Starav, the highest at 1,078m/3,537ft (a brutal ascent from 
    sea-level), then the outlying 957m/3140ft Beinn nan Aighenan and 
    over 997m/3271ft Glas Bheinn Mhor to the overnight stop at the 738m 
    col beneath 1,044m/3425ft Stob Coir’ an Albannaich. That left 
    Albannaich and 928m/3045ft Meall nan Eun for the following 
    morning.
THE ROUTE
A track, map ref 137468, leads to the River Etive of deep, dark 
    pools, from where a detour avoids the environs of Coileitir. Follow 
    the riverside path, cross the Allt Mheuran at the bridge, map ref 
    136460, then south to the base of the north ridge. After a long 
    steady climb, I was on top of Starav (possibly hill of rustling, 
    suggesting the sound of deer) at 2:30pm and with superb views down 
    Loch Etive to Cruachan.
Stroll around the edge of the plateau, then it is a 300m rough 
    eastern descent to the 766m col from where Beinn nan Aighenan (hill 
    of the hinds) look fairly insignificant. However, what is literally 
    overlooked is the descent to the 617m low point leading to a 340m 
    climb on the NNW ridge. The return to the 766m col thus gives an 
    overall ascent of nearly 500m. Leaving rucksacks beside some 
    apparently prominent marker carries risks even on a clear day.
Traverse 892m Meall nan Tri Tighearnan, which just misses out on 
    Top status, to reach the rounded dome of Glas Bheinn Mhor (big 
    greenish/grey hill). The descent path eases the way over the rough 
    north-east nose to the 738m col at 
    the head of the Allt Mheuran, map ref 163434; my overnight bivvy 
    spot chosen for its nearby spring and a common spot to see 
    ptarmigan. I was tucked into my sleeping bag by 9pm but later saw 
    the post-sunset reddish glow to the north-west at the same time as 
    the seemingly large red moon slowly rose from the south-east. 
    Sunrise revealed a cloud-free day and after a short, sharp, stony 
    climb, heading north then curving north-east, I was on Stob Coir’ 
    an Albannaich at 6:45am, this peak of the corrie of the Scotsman 
    perched above a dramatic line of cliffs. Descend south-east to just 
    below 900m then by the obvious grassy rake slanting north to the 
    754m col. Traverse Meall Tarsuinn to the narrow col map, ref 
    184451.
The summit plateau of the modest Meall nan Eun, hill of the 
    birds, is reached on a curving approach. Return to the narrow col 
    and follow the upper Allt Ceitlein, at first through a narrow gorge 
    into Coirean Riabhach. Later the path crosses to the north side and 
    so into the open, grassy Glen Ceitlein.
